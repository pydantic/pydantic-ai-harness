"""Pydantic AI's workspace backend conformance suite, run against `SpritesSandboxBackend`.

`TestFakeSpritesSandboxBackend` runs everywhere, over the fake Sprites SDK, whose commands run in
local subprocesses under a temporary host directory. `TestLiveSpritesSandboxBackend` runs the same
rules against a real Sprite and is gated like `test_sprites_live.py`.

The backend implements `SupportsCommands` only; the suite derives the filesystem operations, and
with them its reattach and destroy rules, through `Workspace`, so those rules run here too.
