"""Pydantic AI's workspace backend conformance suite, run against `SpritesSandboxBackend`.

`TestFakeSpritesSandboxBackend` runs everywhere, over the fake Sprites SDK, whose commands run in
local subprocesses under a temporary host directory. `TestLiveSpritesSandboxBackend` runs the same
rules against a real Sprite and is gated like `test_sprites_live.py`.

The backend implements `SupportsCommands` and `SupportsFilesystem`, so the suite's command,
filesystem, reattach, and destroy rules all run here.
