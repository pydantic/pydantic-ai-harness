"""Integration tests that require a real Daytona sandbox.

The fake-backed suites cover the harness-owned logic: deadline handling, protocol translation,
and exception mapping. This live tier admits only what a correctly written fake could not catch:
real process execution, a client-owned deadline over a real process, one filesystem shared by
Daytona's file API and its process sessions, and real lifecycle state in Daytona's control plane.

Admission rule:
  A test belongs here only when its docstring can name the fake-encoded assumption it
  validates against real Daytona behavior.

Gating:
  * `daytona_live` marker separates this tier from fake-backed tests.
  * skipped unless `PYDANTIC_AI_HARNESS_DAYTONA_LIVE=1` opts in explicitly.
  * also requires a non-empty `DAYTONA_API_KEY`: without one the tests skip, or fail where
    `DAYTONA_REQUIRE_LIVE` is set, as CI does.
  * the module-scoped async `client` fixture keeps the shared Daytona client on one asyncio loop.

Run locally:
`PYDANTIC_AI_HARNESS_DAYTONA_LIVE=1 uv run pytest -m daytona_live tests/daytona_sandbox/test_daytona_live.py`
