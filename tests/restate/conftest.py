"""Test helpers for the Restate durability capability.

No network and no Docker: `FakeRestateContext` is an in-memory stand-in for the Restate context
that reproduces the two behaviors the capability depends on -- a positional journal (each
`run_typed` records its result by encounter order) and a replay that serves stored entries without
re-running the action. Tests activate it by setting the SDK's real context var via
`restate_context(...)`.

Every stored value round-trips through the real Restate serde the capability passes
(`restate.serde.JsonSerde`), so the journal behaves as it does in production. The capability
reduces each value to a JSON-able payload with a `TypeAdapter` before it reaches the journal, so a
value that cannot be serialized fails at that dump, before the serde, identically here and in
production.
