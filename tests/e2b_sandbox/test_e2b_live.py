"""Integration tests that require a real, running E2B sandbox.

The fake-backed suites already cover the harness-owned logic: deadline arithmetic, protocol
translation, path resolution math, and exception mapping. This live tier admits only
regressions a correctly written fake could not catch: real process execution, a client-owned
deadline killing a real process, one filesystem shared by E2B's file API and the shell,
create-time environment propagation, and real lifecycle state in E2B's control plane.

Admission rule:
  A test belongs here only when its docstring can name the fake-encoded assumption it
  validates against real E2B behavior.

Gating:
  * `e2b_live` marker separates this tier from fake-backed tests.
  * skipped unless `PYDANTIC_AI_HARNESS_E2B_LIVE=1` opts in explicitly.
  * also requires a non-empty `E2B_API_KEY`; without one it skips, or fails when
    `E2B_REQUIRE_LIVE=1` (CI's live job). The gate is `pytest_runtest_setup` in `conftest.py`.
  * a module-scoped `anyio_backend` fixture keeps the shared E2B handle on one asyncio loop.

Run locally:
`PYDANTIC_AI_HARNESS_E2B_LIVE=1 uv run pytest -m e2b_live tests/e2b_sandbox/test_e2b_live.py`
