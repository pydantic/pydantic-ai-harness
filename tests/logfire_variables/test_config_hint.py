"""The span an agent reports its code baseline on.

The SDK never creates or updates a managed variable. Every agent emits one
`agent_control_config_hint` span per process carrying everything a config would be created from, and
creating one -- or refreshing a stored baseline the code has moved on from -- is a Logfire-side flow.
These tests are therefore the contract the platform side consumes: the span's name, its attributes,
when it is and is not emitted, and how a baseline too large for a span attribute degrades.

That nothing writes is asserted for every test in this package by the `_refuse_variable_writes`
fixture in `conftest.py`; `test_a_run_writes_nothing_to_the_variable_api` says it once explicitly.

    a blocking round trip whose best-effort failure suppressed the signal. Deduplicating a hint
