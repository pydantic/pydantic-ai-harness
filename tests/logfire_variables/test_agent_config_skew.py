"""What an `AgentConfig` written by a newer Logfire UI or contract costs a *run* of an older SDK.

How leniently a published value validates is the contract's own business, and `logfire.agent_control`
tests it there: a value it cannot act on costs one setting, one instruction entry, or one tool
override rather than the whole config, because an `AgentConfig` that fails validation is reverted
*whole* by Logfire's resolution fallback. What is tested here is the other end of that promise --
that an agent keeps running on the managed config around the piece that was dropped, and says where
the gap is when the drop is only visible at the point the config is applied.
