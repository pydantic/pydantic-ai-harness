**The batteries for your [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) agent.**

---

Pydantic AI's [capabilities](https://ai.pydantic.dev/capabilities/) and [hooks](https://ai.pydantic.dev/hooks/) API is how you give an agent its harness -- bundles of tools, lifecycle hooks, instructions, and model settings that extend what the agent can do without any framework changes.

**Pydantic AI Harness** is the official capability library for Pydantic AI, maintained by the [Pydantic AI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai) team. Pydantic AI core ships capabilities that require model or framework support, and capabilities fundamental to every agent -- [web search](https://ai.pydantic.dev/capabilities/#provider-adaptive-tools), [tool search](https://ai.pydantic.dev/deferred-tools/), [thinking](https://ai.pydantic.dev/capabilities/#thinking). Everything else lives here: standalone building blocks you pick and choose to turn your agent into a coding agent, a research assistant, or anything else. This is also where new capabilities start -- as they stabilize and prove themselves broadly essential, they can graduate into core.

## Installation

```bash
uv add pydantic-ai-harness
```

Extras for specific capabilities:

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[code-mode]"   # CodeMode (adds the Monty sandbox)
```

Requires Python 3.10+ and `pydantic-ai-slim>=1.80.0`.

## Quick start

```python
import logfire
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import MCP  # from the core pydantic-ai package
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

logfire.configure()
logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    capabilities=[
        MCP('https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/'),
        CodeMode(),
    ],
)

result = agent.run_sync('Rank the open PRs on pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness by thumbs-up reactions. Which 5 should we merge first?')
print(result.output)
```

[`MCP`](https://ai.pydantic.dev/capabilities/#provider-adaptive-tools) (from the core `pydantic-ai` package) connects your agent to any MCP server -- here, [GitHub's official MCP server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server).

[`CodeMode`](pydantic_ai_harness/code_mode/) wraps all tools into a single `run_code` tool powered by our [Monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty) sandbox, so the model can orchestrate multiple tool calls with Python code instead of one model round-trip per call.

[`logfire`](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) gives you a trace for every agent run. With CodeMode, you can see the `run_code` span with each nested tool call as a child span -- making it easy to debug what the model's code actually did. See the [Pydantic AI Logfire docs](https://ai.pydantic.dev/logfire/) for setup details.

## Capability matrix

We studied leading coding agents, agent frameworks, and Claw-style assistants to map every capability area that matters for production agents. Each one is tracked as an [issue](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/issues) in this repo.

**Vote on whatever is linked in the Status column** -- PRs if we're actively building it, issues if it's planned -- to help us decide what to work on next.

## Help us prioritize

**Vote on whatever is linked in the Status column above.** If there's a PR, vote on the PR -- it means we're actively building it. If there's only an issue, vote on the issue.

Want something that's not on the list? [Open a capability request](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/issues/new?template=capability-request.yml).

## Build your own

[Capabilities](https://ai.pydantic.dev/capabilities/#building-custom-capabilities) are the primary extension point for Pydantic AI. Any of the existing capabilities in this repo can serve as a reference for building your own.

**Publishing as a standalone package?** Use the `pydantic-ai-<name>` naming convention. See [Publishing capability packages](https://ai.pydantic.dev/extensibility/#publishing-capability-packages).

## Contributing

We welcome capability contributions. Here's how:

1. **Start with an issue.** [Open a capability request](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/issues/new?template=capability-request.yml) describing the behavior you want. This lets us discuss the approach and priority before code is written -- we can close an approach without closing the problem.
2. **Then open a PR.** Once the issue exists, you're welcome to open a PR with an implementation. Link the issue in your PR. We review based on community interest -- upvotes on both the issue and PR count.
3. **Don't chase green CI.** Get the approach working, then let us know. We'll take it from there -- we may push to your branch, rewrite, or open a follow-up PR. You'll be credited as the original author. (See the [Pydantic AI contributing guide](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).)

> **Note**: PRs that modify `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` from non-team members are auto-closed by CI to prevent supply chain risk. If you need a new dependency, [open an issue](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/issues/new).

### Development

```bash
make install   # install dependencies
make format    # ruff format
make lint      # ruff check
make typecheck # pyright strict
make test      # pytest
make testcov   # pytest with 100% branch coverage
```

## Version policy

Pydantic AI Harness uses **0.x versioning** to signal that APIs are still stabilizing. During 0.x:

- **Minor releases** (0.1 → 0.2) may include breaking changes — renamed parameters, changed defaults, restructured APIs. As the library grows, especially as capabilities gain provider-native support (starting as a local implementation, then auto-switching to the provider's built-in API when available), we may need to reshape APIs we couldn't fully anticipate in the initial design.
- **Patch releases** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1) will not intentionally break existing behavior.
- **All breaking changes** are documented in release notes with migration guidance.
- Where practical, we'll keep the previous behavior available under a deprecated name or configuration option before removing it.

This is why Pydantic AI Harness is a separate package from [Pydantic AI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai), which has a [stricter version policy](https://ai.pydantic.dev/version-policy/). As the core capabilities stabilize, we'll move toward 1.0 with stability guarantees to match.
