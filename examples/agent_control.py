"""Build a storefront support agent whose configuration can be rewritten from Logfire.

`AgentControl` makes an agent's instructions, model, model settings, and tool descriptions editable
from Logfire, one addressable piece at a time. So this agent is deliberately assembled from many
pieces: its prompt is six separately addressable blocks, written in five different ways, and its
four tools live in two toolsets.

| Where it is written                                    | Block id                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `Agent(instructions='You are the Northwind ...')`      | `agent`                   |
| `InstructionPart(name='escalation')` beside it         | `agent:escalation`        |
| `StorePolicy(id='store_policy')`, a capability         | `capability:store_policy` |
| `FunctionToolset(id='orders', instructions=...)`       | `toolset:orders`          |
| `FunctionToolset(id='catalog', instructions=...)`       | `toolset:catalog`         |
| `@agent.instructions(name='tenant')`, reading `deps`   | `agent:tenant` (dynamic)  |

Run it with no Logfire configured at all and it answers on the code-default path: nothing resolves,
nothing is different, and it says so. That is the behavior to check first -- an agent that only works
once its config store is reachable has moved a redeploy into an outage.

Point it at a Logfire to see a published config arrive: set `LOGFIRE_BASE_URL` and a
`LOGFIRE_API_KEY` with the `project:read_variables` scope (see `examples/README.md`). Every run
prints what resolved and the prompt block by block, so an edit saved in Logfire is visible on the
next run.
