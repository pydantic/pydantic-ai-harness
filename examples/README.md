# Examples

Complete agents assembled from individual harness capabilities, written to be
read as much as run: every capability choice has the reasoning next to it, and
each example writes out its full configuration so you can copy it into your own
code and tweak it.

If you just want the assembled version, use the packaged harnesses instead
([`Coder`](../docs/coder.md), [`Researcher`](../docs/researcher.md)) — or run one
with zero setup: `uvx --with pydantic-ai-harness clai -a pydantic_ai_harness.coder:coder_agent`.

## Setup

From the repo root:

```bash
make install                      # or: uv sync --all-extras
uv run examples/coding_agent.py
```

Each example states its default model at the top and reads that provider's API
key from the environment (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). Set
`PYDANTIC_AI_MODEL=provider:model` to run against a different model — you'll
then need that provider's key instead.

## The examples

| Example | What it does | Default model |
|---|---|---|
| [`agent_control.py`](agent_control.py) | A support agent whose prompt, model, settings and tool descriptions are editable from Logfire, block by block. Runs on the code-default path with no Logfire configured | `anthropic:claude-fable-5` |
| [`coding_agent.py`](coding_agent.py) | A coding agent for the current repo, built from the blocks that make up `Coder` | `anthropic:claude-fable-5` |
| [`research_agent.py`](research_agent.py) | A web-research agent that cites every claim, built from the blocks that make up `Researcher` | `openai:gpt-5.6-sol` |

Every example exposes a `build_agent()` factory (imported by the test suite, and
handy for embedding the agent in your own code) and a `main()` that runs a small
demo.

### Pointing `agent_control.py` at a Logfire

With no Logfire configured, `agent_control.py` resolves nothing and runs exactly
as the code says -- it reports `reason='code_default'` and prints the prompt it
assembled. That is the path to check first, and it needs no setup at all.

Two more environment variables point it at a Logfire instead:

| Variable | What it is |
|---|---|
| `LOGFIRE_BASE_URL` | The Logfire origin: UI, OTLP and API. Without it the SDK infers a region from the token, so a local platform needs it set (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`) |
| `LOGFIRE_API_KEY` | An API key with `project:read_variables` (and `project:write_variables` to publish a config from outside the UI). This is a different credential from the write token that sends spans: a write token cannot serve the variables API |

With both set, the example calls `logfire.configure()` and
`logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()`, which is how the agent reports itself to your
project and how the config version behind a run reaches a trace. Editing a block
in Logfire then changes the next run's output, with no restart. See
[the Agent Control docs](../docs/agent-control.md) for what a published config can
hold, and
[`integration_tests/logfire_platform/`](../integration_tests/logfire_platform/README.md)
for the suite that checks all of it against a running platform.
