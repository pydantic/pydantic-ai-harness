description: Wrap an agent's tools into a single sandboxed run_code tool so the model orchestrates many calls in one Python program instead of many round-trips.
---

# Code Mode

`CodeMode` replaces individual tool calls with a single sandboxed Python execution environment. Instead of the model issuing one tool call per action, it writes a Python program that calls your tools as functions -- with loops, conditionals, variables, and `asyncio.gather` -- all inside a sandboxed [Monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty) runtime.

[Source](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/tree/main/pydantic_ai_harness/code_mode/)

> While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](index.md#version-policy).

## The problem

Standard tool calling often needs another model turn for each dependent batch of tool calls. An agent that needs to fetch 10 items and then process their results can require many model turns, increasing latency, cost, and context use. Intermediate results also grow the conversation history.

## The solution

`CodeMode` wraps eligible tools into a single `run_code` tool. The model writes sandboxed orchestration code that fans calls out with `asyncio.gather`, filters and transforms results, and returns only what matters. Calls from that code are dispatched through Pydantic AI to the host tools.

| Standard tool calling | Code mode |
|---|---|
| Dependent tool batches across model turns | Many dependent calls in one `run_code` |
| Parallel only when the model emits a batch | Parallelism expressed in Python |
| No local computation | Filter, transform, aggregate in code |
| Large conversation history | Compact -- fewer messages |

Durable execution integrations can record nested calls for deterministic replay.

## Installation

Code mode requires the Monty sandbox, available via the `codemode` extra (the `code-mode` extra is an equivalent alias):

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[codemode]"
```

## Usage

Construct an `Agent` with `CodeMode()` in its `capabilities`, then register tools as usual. Every eligible regular tool becomes callable from inside `run_code`:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[CodeMode()])


@agent.tool_plain
def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """Get current weather for a city."""
    return {'city': city, 'temp_f': 72, 'condition': 'sunny'}


result = agent.run_sync("What's the weather in Paris and Tokyo, in Celsius?")
print(result.output)
```

Inside a single `run_code` call, the model writes code like the following (illustrative -- the exact code the model emits will vary):

```python
import asyncio

paris, tokyo = await asyncio.gather(
    get_weather(city='Paris'),
    get_weather(city='Tokyo'),
)
paris_c = round((paris['temp_f'] - 32) * 5 / 9, 1)
tokyo_c = round((tokyo['temp_f'] - 32) * 5 / 9, 1)
{'paris': paris_c, 'tokyo': tokyo_c}
```

Both weather lookups run in parallel and the conversions run inside Monty, all within one `run_code` call.

## Selective tool sandboxing

By default, `CodeMode(tools='all')` sandboxes every eligible regular tool. Framework control tools, undiscovered deferred tools, native fallbacks, and other code-execution tools remain native. Shell surfaces count as code-execution tools: `Shell`'s `run_command` and `start_command`, and `ModalSandbox`'s `run_command`, sit beside `run_code` rather than inside it, so the model never has to quote a shell command inside a generated Python string. `CapabilityCreation`'s `author_capability` stays native for the same reason: its argument is a complete Python module. Their non-command tools (`read_file`, `check_command`, and so on) are folded into `run_code` like any other tool. The `tools` field is a Pydantic AI `ToolSelector`, so you can control which eligible tools go through the sandbox. Tools that match the selector become callables inside `run_code`; non-matching tools stay visible to the model as regular tool calls.

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

# By name -- only these tools are available inside run_code
CodeMode(tools=['search', 'fetch'])

# By predicate -- (ctx, tool_def) -> bool | Awaitable[bool]
CodeMode(tools=lambda ctx, td: td.name != 'dangerous_tool')

# By metadata -- combine with SetToolMetadata or a toolset's .with_metadata()
CodeMode(tools={'code_mode': True})
```

### Metadata-based selection

Use metadata when the decision should travel with a tool or toolset, rather than with one `CodeMode` instance. This suits shared toolsets: the toolset author tags the tools that are safe and useful to call from generated code, and each agent opts into that tag with `CodeMode(tools={...})`.

`CodeMode(tools={'code_mode': True})` uses the standard Pydantic AI [`ToolSelector`](/ai/api/pydantic-ai/tools/) metadata form. A tool is sandboxed when its `ToolDefinition.metadata` contains all of the selector's key-value pairs. Extra metadata on the tool is fine, and nested dictionaries are matched by deep inclusion.

The common pattern is to tag an entire toolset with `.with_metadata(...)`:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.toolsets import FunctionToolset
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode


def search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the web."""
    return f'results for {query}'


def fetch(url: str) -> str:
    """Fetch a URL."""
    return f'contents of {url}'


search_tools = FunctionToolset(tools=[search, fetch]).with_metadata(code_mode=True)

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    toolsets=[search_tools],
    capabilities=[CodeMode(tools={'code_mode': True})],
)
```

Here `search` and `fetch` are removed from the model-facing tool list and become callable functions inside `run_code`. Tools without `metadata['code_mode'] == True` stay visible as regular tool calls.

## Tool Search interaction

When you mark tools or whole toolsets `defer_loading=True` ([Tool Search](/ai/tools-toolsets/tools-advanced/#tool-search)), `CodeMode` keeps them out of `run_code` while they're undiscovered -- they pass straight through, so Tool Search drives them as usual (sent on the wire with `defer_loading` on providers with native tool search; otherwise dropped until discovered, with a `search_tools` tool alongside `run_code`). `CodeMode` uses `RunContext.is_tool_available` to follow that reveal state. Once the model discovers a tool -- or loads the deferred capability that owns it -- `CodeMode` folds it into `run_code` like any other tool from then on, so it's callable from generated code. (The tool keeps `defer_loading=True`, which records what its author asked for; what changes is its availability for the run.)

That fold-in grows `run_code`'s description, which invalidates the prompt-cache prefix once at the moment of discovery (turns with no discovery stay cache-warm). Two ways to avoid the bust:

- Pass `dynamic_catalog=True` to keep `run_code`'s description static across discoveries. The catalog of sandboxed-tool signatures moves into the agent instructions (as a dynamic [`InstructionPart`](/ai/api/pydantic-ai/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.InstructionPart)) and newly-discovered tools are announced via [`ctx.enqueue`](/ai/api/pydantic-ai/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.enqueue) instead of by rebuilding the description:

  ```python
  from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

  CodeMode(dynamic_catalog=True)
  ```

  This pays off when paired with Tool Search: the tool-definitions block stays byte-stable so the prefix cache survives discoveries, at the cost of a larger (but cache-friendly) system prompt. With a fixed toolset and no Tool Search, the default keeps the system prompt shorter and is the better choice.

- To instead keep a Tool Search corpus fully native -- never folded into `run_code`, but not callable from inside it -- exclude it with a `tools` selector; corpus members carry `with_native` set to the managing native tool:

  ```python
  from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

  CodeMode(tools=lambda ctx, td: td.with_native is None)
  ```

## Return values

The last expression in the snippet is automatically captured as the return value -- the model does not need to `print()`. An assignment stores a value in the REPL but does not return it. A final expression that evaluates to `None` is also treated as no result. Without a non-`None` final expression or print output, `run_code` returns `{}`. Put the assigned name on the final line:

```python
result = await get_weather(city='Paris')
result
```

Reserve `print()` for supplementary logging: printed text is surfaced separately, wrapped alongside the last-expression result.

| Scenario | Return |
|---|---|
| Non-`None` final expression with no print output | Last expression value |
| Final assignment or `None` result with no print output | `{}` |
| Print output with no final expression or a `None` result | `{'output': '<printed text>'}` |
| Print output with a plain, non-`None` final expression | `{'output': '<printed text>', 'result': <last expression>}` |
| Multimodal final expression with no print output | Returned natively for model processing |
| Print output with a multimodal final expression | List with printed text followed by native multimodal content |

Printed output is limited to 10 MiB. Exceeding the limit makes `run_code` return a model retry.

Sandbox execution is bounded by `resource_limits`, which defaults to 30 seconds of execution time
and a 256 MiB heap. What this guarantees is a per-snippet ceiling: no single `run_code` snippet runs
longer than `max_duration_secs` of sandbox time, which is what stops a runaway loop. Time spent
awaiting a nested tool is excluded from that timer.

It is not a run-wide CPU budget, and it cannot be relied on as one. Monty applies the limits per
sandbox session, so consecutive `run_code` calls draw down one shared allowance and each new session
starts with a full one. Sessions are replaced by `restart: true` and by the failures that reset the
REPL: a worker crash, a type error, a host-side failure, and a syntax error before any code has run.
Each of those renews the allowance without the model asking for a restart. An ordinary exception
inside a snippet is not one of them.

Once a session's allowance is spent, every later `run_code` call fails on arrival, including
snippets that would cost almost nothing, because they reuse the same session. Rewriting the code
does not help. `restart: true` is what recovers it, at the cost of the REPL state that session was
holding, so any variables, imports, and definitions have to be recreated. `run_code` says as much
in the retry it returns, and that retry also reports the nested calls the snippet already made, so
restarting does not throw away the only record of them. The behaviour is worth knowing when
choosing `max_duration_secs`: set it low and a long agent run will spend it on ordinary work and
pay a restart to continue.

Nested tool calls are bounded separately by `max_tool_calls`, which defaults to 100 per `run_code`
call. The budget is reserved before each call is scheduled, so a snippet cannot dispatch more work
than it allows. A call past the budget fails at its call site inside the sandbox. A snippet that
catches the error keeps the results of the calls that already completed and can return them. A
snippet that lets it propagate gets a model retry reporting how many nested calls started,
followed by per-call detail: what each was called with, and whether it returned, raised, or was
denied. Calls that raised are included rather than filtered out, since a tool can apply a change
before failing. That detail is bounded -- arguments and results are previewed, and the list stops
at a size cap and says how many entries it left out -- so a large payload cannot inflate the
retry. The reported total stays exact whether or not the list was cut, which is what tells the
model some calls are missing from what it can see. The list is context for the model, not a guard:
nothing stops it from calling those tools again, so treat it as informing the next attempt rather
than preventing a repeat.

Override them with `resource_limits={'max_duration_secs': 10, 'max_memory': 134_217_728}` and
`max_tool_calls=25`. Pass `resource_limits='unlimited'` only when another execution boundary
supplies equivalent limits.

When `CodeMode` runs inside a Temporal workflow, it disables `max_duration_secs`, including an
explicit override. `run_code` is replayed in workflow code, so measuring elapsed time there could
make replay choose a different path from the recorded workflow. The memory cap still applies. Put
time-bounded work behind a Temporal activity instead.

## REPL state

State persists between `run_code` calls within the same agent run -- variables, imports, and function definitions carry over. Pass `restart: true` in the tool call to reset state. If a worker crash or host-side execution failure invalidates the session, `run_code` returns a model retry that reports the reset; the next snippet must recreate any required state.

## Eager execution (experimental)

`eager=True` executes streamed `run_code` snippets while the model is still generating
them: each top-level statement runs in the live REPL as soon as it has fully streamed,
and the `run_code` dispatch executes only the remainder. This overlaps execution latency
with model generation. Nothing is predicted, so nothing runs that the program did not
ask for -- and nothing is rolled back: side effects land before the tool call is
committed, which is why the tier is opt-in.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.code_mode import CodeMode

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[CodeMode(eager=True)],
)
```

A statement that fails mid-stream leaves the session exactly as a failed snippet does
today: assignments made before the failing line persist, and the error surfaces as the
`run_code` result for the model to retry against (prints from statements that succeeded
earlier are included). `restart: true` discards the executed prefix along with the rest
of the session. If the code submitted at execution no longer matches the prefix that
already ran (a provider rewriting the part mid-stream), the session resets and the model
is asked to resend the snippet.

Budgets span the whole call: `max_tool_calls` counts nested calls across the streamed
prefix and the dispatched remainder together, and fragments from concurrently streamed
`run_code` parts execute one at a time against the session.

Two consequences of running before the call completes:

- Statements execute before the completed `run_code` call reaches `before_tool_execute`
  hooks, so a guard capability that would block, rewrite, or defer `run_code` for
  approval is applied only to the dispatch, after the streamed prefix already ran. Do not
  enable `eager` on runs that gate `run_code` behind such a guard.
- A `restart: true` call re-executes the full snippet on a fresh session. The watcher
  stops feeding as soon as `restart` appears in the streamed arguments, but statements
  fed before the key streams have already run once, so their side effects repeat.

Enabling `eager` puts runs in streaming mode. It requires the asyncio event loop; on
other async backends (Trio) the watcher stays inactive and `run_code` executes normally
at dispatch. Under durable execution (Temporal, DBOS) the option is likewise inactive:
statements only run when the completed tool call executes.

## Speculative execution (experimental)

`speculate` names tools that may start executing while the model is still streaming the
`run_code` call. The streamed `code` argument is scanned as it arrives; a call to a named
tool whose arguments are all keyword literals launches as soon as its closing paren streams,
even while its enclosing statement (an `if` arm, a `with` body) is still being generated.
When the completed snippet executes, matching dispatches claim the in-flight results instead
of starting the tool cold. Extraction is textual, so a call spelled inside a string literal
or comment can launch too; such launches waste a pure call and are evicted at commit.
This overlaps tool latency with model generation (speculative programmatic tool calling,
<https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2026/spec-ptc/>).

```python
agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[CodeMode(speculate=['search', 'fetch'])],
)
```

Name only tools without observable side effects: a speculated call can run for a branch the
snippet never takes, so early execution must be harmless to repeat or discard. Launches that
the snippet never claims are cancelled when it finishes. `sequential` tools are never
speculated, tool hooks fire at launch time rather than at claim time, and enabling `speculate`
puts runs in streaming mode. Under durable execution (Temporal, DBOS) the option is inactive.
Aggregate counters are exposed on `CodeMode.speculation_stats` (`launched`, `adopted`,
`evicted`).

Instead of naming tools, pass `speculate='declared'` to trust evidence the tools carry
themselves: first-party tools marked `Tool(..., metadata={'read_only': True})` (or
`'idempotent'`), and MCP tools whose server publishes the `readOnlyHint` or `idempotentHint`
tool annotation. A declaration is the tool author's claim, not a proof; `'declared'` extends
the same trust to authors that an explicit list places in you.

```python
agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[CodeMode(speculate='declared')],
    tools=[Tool(search, metadata={'read_only': True})],
)
```

Speculation looks past program order: a call inside an `if`/`else` launches for both arms as
soon as the conditional has streamed, even while an earlier blocking statement is still
executing. The taken arm claims its result; the untaken arm's launch is discarded and counted
as wasted. Wasted launches are the cost of hiding branch latency, which is why eligibility
demands side-effect freedom.

The tiers compose: with both `eager=True` and `speculate` set, eager execution advances
the program frontier through the live REPL while speculation launches eligible calls the
frontier has not reached (branch arms, calls behind a blocking statement), and the eager
feeds' dispatches claim those launches. In a snippet that starts with a blocking shell
command and then branches on its result, the command runs while the model is still
generating and both arms' reads are in flight before it returns.


### Speculation events

Each speculation transition is emitted as a typed
[capability event](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/core-concepts/hooks/) in the `code_mode`
namespace, so UIs and other capabilities can observe the lifecycle live from the run's event
stream: `SpeculativeCodeUpdateEvent` (the decoded snippet so far, with its closed-statement
boundary), `SpeculativeCallLaunchedEvent` (with the launching statement's line span),
`SpeculativeCallSettledEvent`, and -- once the snippet executes -- `SpeculativeCallClaimedEvent`,
`SpeculativeCallMissedEvent`, and `SpeculativeCallEvictedEvent`. Launches carry a `phase`
field: `streaming` launches overlap the model's own generation, while `execution` launches
are the prefetch that runs when the snippet starts executing -- the complete code is parsed
and every literal eligible call not already in flight starts at once, so the snippet's
sequential awaits collect from concurrently-running tasks instead of blocking one another.
With `eager` also enabled, each committed prefix reports an `EagerPrefixCommittedEvent`:
how many statements the pump executed during generation (`executed_ms`) and how long the
dispatch still waited for it (`waited_ms`); the difference is the generation overlap eager
bought for that snippet. The same numbers persist in message history: a `run_code`
return's history-only metadata gains `eager` (`statements`, `executed_ms`, `waited_ms`)
and `speculation` (`hits`, `hidden_ms`, `misses`, `wasted`) entries when the tiers did
work, alongside the existing nested `tool_calls`/`tool_returns` records. The model's
visible content stays `{'output': ..., 'result': ...}`; telemetry does not spend tokens.
Delivery differs by phase:
stream-phase events (updates, launches, settles) are yielded directly into the wrapped event
stream, interleaved live with the argument deltas that produced them -- so they reach stream
consumers (`event_stream_handler`, UI adapters) but bypass `@on_event` listener dispatch.
Execution-phase events (claims, misses, evictions) are emitted as capability events when the
snippet finishes, and reach listeners as well. Emission is best-effort: contexts without a
live event stream drop events rather than failing the work they describe. Requires a
pydantic-ai release carrying capability events.

## Temporal durability

Install both integrations:

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[codemode,temporal]"
```

Construct the named agent and its stable-ID toolsets outside the workflow, then attach
`TemporalDurability` alongside `CodeMode`:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.durable_exec.temporal import TemporalDurability
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    name='coding-agent',
    capabilities=[CodeMode(), TemporalDurability()],
)
```

Follow the [Pydantic AI Temporal guide](/ai/capabilities/durable_execution/temporal/) to call the
plain agent from a workflow and register its activities with `PydanticAIPlugin` and either
`__pydantic_ai_agents__` or `AgentPlugin`.

`PydanticAIPlugin` passes `pydantic_monty` through Temporal's workflow sandbox. This makes Monty
runnable there, but `run_code` still executes in workflow code and is re-executed during replay.
Model requests and, by default, nested tool calls cross Temporal activity boundaries;
`asyncio.gather` can schedule nested tool activities concurrently. The REPL is process-local state
for one agent run, not durable storage. Replay reconstructs it by running the recorded snippets
again against recorded activity results.

Keep workflow-side code deterministic. `mount` reads and writes, `os_access` callbacks, and
host-clock calls happen again during replay; changing their results can change which activities the
workflow schedules and cause a `NondeterminismError`. Put external reads, writes, clock access, and
other side effects in wrapped tools so Temporal records them as activities. Replay may not flag
changed arguments when the same activity remains at the same history position, so replay validation
is not a substitute for this boundary. Temporal activity timeouts apply to nested tools, not pure
computation inside `run_code`; move time-bounded computation behind an activity.

## Observability

Nested tool calls inside `run_code` produce their own spans when instrumented with [Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) or any OpenTelemetry backend -- the easiest way to understand what code mode actually did, since each `run_code` span fans out into the tool calls the model issued from inside the sandbox. See the [Pydantic AI Logfire docs](/ai/integrations/logfire/) for setup.

The `run_code` tool return also carries metadata with every nested call, keyed by call id:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.messages import ToolReturnPart
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[CodeMode()])


@agent.tool_plain
def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """Get current weather for a city."""
    return {'city': city, 'temp_f': 72}


result = agent.run_sync("What's the weather in Paris?")

for msg in result.all_messages():
    for part in msg.parts:
        if isinstance(part, ToolReturnPart) and part.tool_name == 'run_code':
            metadata = part.metadata or {}
            tool_calls = metadata['tool_calls']    # dict[str, ToolCallPart]
            tool_returns = metadata['tool_returns']  # dict[str, ToolReturnPart]
```

## In practice

A representative run wires `CodeMode` up against an MCP server and a web search and asks it to find the most-discussed Hacker News story across three feeds, pull the comment thread and the submitter's profile, and search the web for follow-up coverage. `CodeMode` collapses that into two `run_code` calls: the first fetches all three feeds in parallel via `asyncio.gather`, dedupes by id, filters by score, and ranks by comment count -- in plain Python; the second batches the three follow-up calls (`hn_get_thread`, `hn_get_user`, `duckduckgo_search`) together.

[![CodeMode's first run_code: parallel asyncio.gather over three HN feeds, then a dedupe and a score filter](images/code-mode-trace.png)](https://logfire-us.pydantic.dev/public-trace/84bcf123-2106-49da-9f6f-5c26395339bb?spanId=7650806a0785b946)

**[See the full Logfire trace ->](https://logfire-us.pydantic.dev/public-trace/84bcf123-2106-49da-9f6f-5c26395339bb?spanId=7650806a0785b946)** Each `run_code` span fans out into the tool calls the model issued from inside the sandbox.

## Filesystem and OS access

Sandboxed code starts with no access to the host's files, environment, or clock. Two parameters add controlled filesystem, environment, or clock behavior.

Both parameters are fixed when the capability is built, so construct `CodeMode` per request to scope the configured access to that request.

### `mount` -- share host directories

Reach for `mount` when the agent works with real files: analyzing a dataset you've dropped in a folder and writing a report back, editing a checkout, or processing a batch of documents. Sandboxed `pathlib` code reads and writes under the mounted path. (For environment variables or the clock, use `os_access` instead.)

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_monty import MountDir
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

# The agent can read /work/data.csv and write /work/summary.md back to the host:
agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    capabilities=[CodeMode(mount=MountDir(virtual_path='/work', host_path='/tmp/agent-workspace', mode='read-write'))],
)
```

A `MountDir` defaults to copy-on-write `mode='overlay'`: the sandbox reads host files and sees writes made during the current `run_code` call, but Monty discards those writes before the next call and they do **not** reach the host. Pass `mode='read-write'` when later calls need to read the writes, or `mode='read-only'` to forbid writes. `mount` also accepts a list of `MountDir` for multiple mount points.

### `os_access` -- answer the sandbox's OS calls yourself

Reach for `os_access` when the agent needs environment variables, the current date and time, or filesystem behavior you control. Hand it a ready-made OS implementation (`AbstractOS`), or a callback that decides each call -- so you can inject just the secrets it needs, pin "now" for reproducible runs, or route file access to your own store.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_monty import OSAccess
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

# Give the agent a fixed set of environment values:
agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    capabilities=[CodeMode(os_access=OSAccess(environ={'API_BASE': 'https://api.example.com'}))],
)
```

A callback receives each OS call and decides its fate:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_monty import NOT_HANDLED
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

allowed_env = {'API_KEY': 'sk-...'}


def my_os(fn, args, kwargs):
    if fn == 'os.getenv':
        # Answer the call: allow-listed keys resolve, every other key reads back
        # as None -- absent, exactly like a real unset variable.
        return allowed_env.get(args[0])
    # Refuse everything else: NOT_HANDLED makes the call fail in the sandbox.
    return NOT_HANDLED


agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[CodeMode(os_access=my_os)])
```

Your callback's return value decides the call's fate, and the two outcomes are easy to confuse:

- **Return any value** -- including `None`, `''`, or `0` -- and that becomes the result the sandbox sees. `os.getenv` returning `None` looks exactly like a normal unset variable, so the agent's code keeps running. This is how you *hide* something: answer with an empty value.
- **Return `NOT_HANDLED`** and the call is treated as unsupported: it raises inside the sandbox and the model gets a retry. This *refuses* a capability outright -- use it to block, not to say "no value". Returning `NOT_HANDLED` for a key the agent reasonably expects will burn retries.

!!! warning "Host access depends on the configuration"
    `mount` exposes selected host directories. The built-in `OSAccess` uses an isolated in-memory filesystem and environment but the host clock by default; a custom handler or `CallbackFile` can expose other host resources. Prefer constructing `CodeMode` per request so any granted access is scoped to that request.

!!! note "Monty-specific types"
    These parameters use Monty's `AbstractOS`/`MountDir` types from `pydantic_monty`.

## Sandbox restrictions

Code runs inside [Monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty), a sandboxed Python subset. Key restrictions:

- No third-party imports. Allowed stdlib modules: `sys`, `typing`, `asyncio`, `math`, `json`, `re`, `unicodedata`, `datetime`, `os`, `pathlib` (each must be imported before use).
- `asyncio.gather(...)` accepts positional awaitables but no keyword arguments. Other task creation and wait APIs are unavailable.
- No wall-clock or timing primitives by default: `asyncio.sleep`, `datetime.datetime.now()`, `datetime.date.today()`, and the `time` module. `datetime.datetime.now()` / `datetime.date.today()` become available when an `os_access` handler implements them (the built-in `OSAccess` does); `asyncio.sleep` and `time` never do.
- No `import *`.
- Filesystem I/O needs an `os_access` handler or a `mount`; `os.getenv` / `os.environ` need an `os_access` handler.
- Tools requiring approval or with deferred (`CallDeferred`) execution are sandboxed like any other tool; without a `HandleDeferredToolCalls` (or equivalent) capability on the agent to resolve them inline, calling one from `run_code` raises an error that surfaces to the model as a retry.

## Agent spec (YAML/JSON)

`CodeMode` works with Pydantic AI's [agent spec](/ai/core-concepts/agent-spec/) feature for defining agents in YAML or JSON:

```yaml
# agent.yaml
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6
capabilities:
  - CodeMode: {}
```

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

agent = Agent.from_file('agent.yaml', custom_capability_types=[CodeMode])
result = agent.run_sync('...')
print(result.output)
```

Pass `custom_capability_types` so the spec loader knows how to instantiate `CodeMode`. Arguments can be passed in the YAML too:

```yaml
capabilities:
  - CodeMode:
      tools: ['search', 'fetch']
      max_retries: 5
```
