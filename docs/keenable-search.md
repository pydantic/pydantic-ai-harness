# Keenable Search

`KeenableSearch` gives an agent web research tools backed by the
[Keenable](https://keenable.ai) search API: search that returns a short excerpt
of each hit, and full-page retrieval for digging into a specific URL.

[Source](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/tree/main/pydantic_ai_harness/keenable/)

> While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](index.md#version-policy).

## The problem

Web research needs two tools that have to agree with each other: search, to
survey what exists, and retrieval, to read the pages worth reading. Wiring them
together means budgeting what each returns, or the agent either sees titles
with no substance or drowns in full pages it was going to discard.

Getting there usually also means an account, an API key, and another vendor SDK
in the dependency tree before the first query runs.

`KeenableSearch` bundles the plumbing into a single
[capability](/ai/core-concepts/capabilities/) — the two tools, their output
budgets, and short research guidance in the system prompt — and needs neither a
key nor an install to run.

## Usage

Nothing to install and nothing to configure: Keenable's endpoints are keyless
by default, and this capability talks to them over `httpx`, which
`pydantic-ai-harness` already depends on.

```python {title="keenable_search.py" test="skip" lint="skip"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import KeenableSearch

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[KeenableSearch()])
result = agent.run_sync('What changed in the EU AI Act this year? Cite your sources.')
print(result.output)
```

The capability adds two tools:

- `web_search(query)` — the matching pages, each with title, URL, and a short
  excerpt.
- `get_page(url)` — one page as markdown.

Both return a [`ToolReturn`][pydantic_ai.messages.ToolReturn] whose
`metadata['sources']` lists the URLs and titles behind the result, so an
application can render citations from
[`ToolReturnPart.metadata`][pydantic_ai.messages.ToolReturnPart] without
parsing the text.

## Configuration

```python {title="keenable_search_configured.py" test="skip" lint="skip"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import KeenableSearch

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    capabilities=[
        KeenableSearch(
            num_results=10,
            max_snippet_chars=800,
            max_page_chars=20_000,
        )
    ],
)
```

| Field | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `num_results` | `5` | How many results `web_search` returns. |
| `max_snippet_chars` | `500` | Excerpt budget per search result. |
| `max_page_chars` | `10_000` | Page budget for `get_page`; longer pages are truncated and marked. |
| `guidance` | `None` | Replaces the default research instructions; `''` contributes none. |
| `client` | `None` | A `KeenableClient` to use instead of the default HTTP client. |

`max_snippet_chars` exists because Keenable returns whole-page text on every
search result, an order of magnitude more than the snippet a typical search API
returns. Left unbounded, a single `web_search` would spend the context window
on pages the agent has not chosen to read yet; `get_page` is how it opts into
one.

## Authentication

Keenable is keyless by default, so nothing is required to get started. An API
key raises rate limits:

```bash
export KEENABLE_API_KEY='keen_...'
```

Set `KEENABLE_API_URL` to point at a different Keenable deployment. It must be
`https`, except against loopback for local development.

To configure either explicitly rather than through the environment, pass a
client:

```python {title="keenable_client.py" test="skip" lint="skip"}
from pydantic_ai_harness.keenable import HttpKeenableClient, KeenableSearch

KeenableSearch(client=HttpKeenableClient(api_key='keen_...'))
```

Any object satisfying the `KeenableClient` protocol works, which is also how
tests substitute a fake.

## Errors

Rate limits, transient 5xx responses, and network failures become
[`ModelRetry`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.ModelRetry], so the model can wait and
rephrase rather than aborting the run. A `401`/`403` propagates: a rejected API
key is configuration the model cannot fix.
