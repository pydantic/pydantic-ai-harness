# Restate Durability

`RestateDurability` makes an agent run durable on [Restate](https://restate.dev), a
durable-execution engine (Python SDK `restate-sdk`). Attach the capability and call `agent.run()`
inside a Restate service handler: every model request, MCP call, and function tool call is journaled
into a Restate run step (`ctx.run_typed(...)`), so a handler that crashes or is retried mid-run
replays from the journal instead of repeating the work. A completed step is served from its journal
entry on replay instead of being recomputed, so tokens are not re-spent on work that already
finished. A step is journaled after it runs, so a crash between a tool's side effect and its journal
entry re-runs the tool on recovery: keep tool side effects idempotent. Outside a Restate context the
capability is transparent and the run is a normal, non-durable agent run.

Restate Durability is a released, non-experimental capability. Pydantic AI Harness is still on 0.x
releases, so the API may change between minor releases. See the repository
[version policy](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness#version-policy).

## Installation

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[restate]" "pydantic-ai-slim[openai]"
```

## Quick start

Construct the agent with the capability and call it from a Restate service handler, then serve the
app with the Restate SDK. The agent needs a `name`; it prefixes every step name.

```python {test="skip"}
import restate
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.restate import RestateDurability

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5', name='analyst', capabilities=[RestateDurability()])
analyst = restate.Service('analyst')


@analyst.handler()
async def analyse(ctx: restate.Context, prompt: str) -> str:
    result = await agent.run(prompt)
    return result.output


app = restate.app([analyst])
```

The handler runs with a Restate `Context` active, which is how the capability knows to journal. Call
`agent.run()` (async) from the async handler.

## What gets journaled, and what replay means

Each of these is wrapped in its own `ctx.run_typed(...)`, so once it completes its result is
journaled and served from the journal on replay rather than being recomputed:

- **model requests** -- `{name}__model.request`, `.request_stream`, and `.cancel_suspended_response`
  (the request's model id is appended as a `.{model_id}` suffix when it differs from the agent's
  default);
- **function tool calls** -- `{name}__function_toolset__{id}.call_tool:{tool_name}`;
- **MCP I/O** -- `{name}__mcp_server__{id}.get_tools`, `.get_instructions`, and
  `.call_tool:{tool_name}`;
- **dynamic toolset resolution and calls** -- `{name}__dynamic_toolset__{id}.get_tools` and
  `.call_tool:{tool_name}`. A `DynamicToolset` built at construction time is resolved inside the
  step (its factory runs there, not in handler code), so its resolution and inner tool calls are
  journaled and not re-run on recovery;
- **event-stream handler calls** -- `{name}__event_stream_handler`, when an `event_stream_handler`
  is set.

Replay means: after a crash or retry, Restate re-runs the handler from the top. Plain Python in the
handler body runs again, but each journaled step returns its stored result instead of re-issuing the
model request or re-calling the tool. A `ModelRetry`, `ApprovalRequired`, or `CallDeferred` raised by
a tool crosses the journal as a serialized value (with its metadata preserved), so on replay the same
outcome is reproduced without re-running the tool.

Restate's journal identity is positional (encounter order); the step name is a label for
observability, not the identity. A replay reaches the steps in the same order and lines each entry up
with its recorded result, so the handler's step sequence must stay stable across a resume.

## Constraints

- The agent needs a `name` (or pass `name=` to `RestateDurability`); it prefixes every step name.
- Leaf toolsets that execute their own tools (function toolsets, MCP servers) need a unique `id`,
  which identifies their steps within the handler. A `DynamicToolset` also needs an `id`; it is
  supported when built at construction time, but cannot be added per-run via `run(toolsets=...)`.
- A journaled tool's return value is written to the journal as JSON bytes, so it must be
  JSON-serializable. Structured returns such as `ToolReturn` and `BinaryContent` are encoded by
  Pydantic first, so they round-trip.
- The executing toolsets are fixed when the agent is constructed. Passing an executing toolset
  per-run via `run(toolsets=...)` inside a handler raises a `UserError`, because a runtime toolset
  would re-run its side effects on recovery. Non-executing toolsets such as `ExternalToolset` are
  allowed at runtime.
- Tool calls run one at a time inside a handler. A journal entry's identity is its encounter order,
  so concurrently scheduled tool calls could claim each other's entries on replay. Outside a Restate
  context the agent keeps its configured parallelism.
- Streaming inside a handler is a replay, not a live wire: the model stream is consumed and captured
  inside the step, and the run-side stream replays the captured events.
- `ctx.enqueue()` is not available inside a journaled tool, because a replay serves the recorded step
  output and would drop the enqueued messages. Enqueue from handler-level code instead.

## Per-tool opt-out

A function tool can opt out of journaling with `metadata={'restate': False}`, which runs it inline in
the handler rather than in a step. Reach for this for a cheap, side-effect-free tool where a journal
entry would add more overhead than it saves.

```python {test="skip"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.toolsets import FunctionToolset
from pydantic_ai_harness.restate import RestateDurability

tools = FunctionToolset(id='math')


@tools.tool_plain(metadata={'restate': False})
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b


agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5', name='calc', toolsets=[tools], capabilities=[RestateDurability()])
```

`False` is the only supported value for the `restate` metadata key. Every step is journaled through
one shared set of run options, so a mapping (`metadata={'restate': {...}}`) has nothing to apply and
raises a `UserError` rather than being dropped. The opt-out and this rule apply to a tool from a
dynamic toolset as well: `False` runs it inline (its listing stays journaled), and a mapping raises.

MCP tools cannot opt out: they perform I/O and so are always journaled. Setting
`metadata={'restate': False}` on an MCP tool raises a `UserError`.

## Composition with other capabilities

`RestateDurability` orders itself innermost, so any other capability's contribution to a model
request is already applied inside the journaled step. Attach it alongside other capabilities as
usual.
