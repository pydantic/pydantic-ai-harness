title: Run AI agents in the background with retries and timeouts
description: Run long-running LLM tasks outside HTTP requests, retry failed tool calls, and check background job status with Pydantic AI and Render Workflows.

# Render Workflows

Run long-running AI agents in the background with separate retries, timeouts, and compute settings for model requests
and tool calls. The [Render Workflows](https://render.com/docs/workflows) integration runs the agent loop in an entry
task and supported operations as child tasks, each with its own status, logs, and result. For example, a tool that
processes a large document can have a longer timeout than the model calls around it.

If you only need background execution, a native Render task around `agent.run(...)` may be enough.

> While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](index.md#version-policy).

## Before you start

The example uses Pydantic AI's `TestModel` and a mock weather tool, so it needs no LLM API key or Render deployment.
The model generates sample tool arguments and returns fixed text rather than interpreting the prompt.

You need Python 3.11 or later. Install the [Render CLI](https://render.com/docs/cli) 2.28.0 or later separately. The installation below uses Pydantic AI 2.46.0 and Render SDK 1.2.0, the versions tested with these examples.

## 1. Install dependencies

In a new directory, initialize a project with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) using `uv init --bare`; for an existing uv project, run the installation command directly. If you use pip, first create and activate a virtual environment.

Until a Harness release includes this integration, install it from the repository checkout containing it. Replace `/path/to/pydantic-ai-harness` with the checkout's absolute path:

```bash
pip/uv-add "/path/to/pydantic-ai-harness[render]" "pydantic-ai-slim==2.46.0" "render==1.2.0"
```

For a published Harness release that includes the integration, replace `/path/to/pydantic-ai-harness[render]` with `pydantic-ai-harness[render]`. The `render` extra supplies the Python SDK and its `render-workflows` executable.

## 2. Add the integration to an agent

Save the following as `app.py` in your project directory:

```python {title="app.py" names="defined"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel
from render import TaskContext, Workflows

from pydantic_ai_harness import RenderWorkflows


async def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    return f'It is sunny in {city}.'


app = Workflows()
workflows = RenderWorkflows(app)
agent = Agent(
    TestModel(custom_output_text='The workflow completed.'),
    name='support',
    tools=[get_weather],
    capabilities=[workflows],
)


@workflows.task
async def support(ctx: TaskContext, prompt: str) -> str:
    del ctx
    return (await agent.run(prompt)).output
```

If you already have an agent, keep its model, instructions, and tools. Add `workflows` to its `capabilities` list,
and put the call to `agent.run(...)` inside a function decorated with `@workflows.task`, as shown above. Create the
agent and its tools at module load time so Render can register their tasks before starting the worker; attach
one `RenderWorkflows` instance per agent and use the same `app` object throughout.

The `support` function is the task you will submit. Render supplies its `TaskContext`, so callers only pass the
`prompt` argument. The `@workflows.task` decorator lets the integration run model requests and supported tool calls
as child tasks. Using a plain `@app.task`, or calling the agent outside a `@workflows.task` function, leaves those
operations in the same process as the agent.

## 3. Start the local task server

From the directory containing `app.py`, run:

```bash
py-cli render workflows dev -- render-workflows app:app
```

The server listens on port `8120` and lists the registered tasks, including `support` and `support__model.request`.
Keep it running for the following commands.

With pip, run `render workflows dev -- render-workflows app:app` from your activated environment. The [local development guide](https://render.com/docs/workflows-local-development) covers port options and the local server's limits.

## 4. Run the agent and check its result

In another terminal, start the `support` task with a prompt:

```bash
render workflows tasks runs start support --local --input '["Check the weather."]' --confirm --output json
```

Copy the returned `id` into the following command to check the job's status and retrieve its result:

```bash
render workflows tasks runs show <RUN_ID> --local --output json
```

A successful run has `status: "completed"` and `results: ["The workflow completed."]`. If the job is still running, repeat the status command until it finishes.

To inspect the model and tool calls separately, list their task runs:

```bash
render workflows tasks runs list 'support__model.request' --local --output json
render workflows tasks runs list 'support__function_toolset__<agent>.call_tool' --local --output json
```

This example produces two model requests and one weather-tool call, each with a `parentTaskRunId` matching the entry task's ID. Keep the server running to try the Python client in step 7. Stop it with Ctrl+C when you are done; its in-memory run history is lost on shutdown.

## 5. Use your own model and tools

Install the provider dependency for the OpenAI example:

```bash
pip/uv-add "pydantic-ai-slim[openai]==2.46.0"
```

To make real model requests, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the terminal where you start the worker. In `app.py`, replace
`TestModel(custom_output_text='The workflow completed.')` with `'openai:gpt-5.6-sol'` and remove the `TestModel` import.
Restart the server and repeat step 4; the response now comes from the model and will vary with the prompt.

Replace `get_weather` with your own tool functions and update the agent's `tools` list to use them. Their arguments
and results must be JSON serializable because the integration sends them between tasks. For a document-processing
tool, for example, pass a document ID or storage URL and load the document inside the tool.

You can keep `TestModel` and the mock weather tool while working through the remaining steps without an LLM API key.

## 6. Configure retries and timeouts

To give model requests and tool calls different retry limits, timeouts, or compute, replace the `app` and
`workflows` declarations in `app.py` with the following block. Keep it before the `Agent(...)` declaration:

```python {names="defined"}
from render import Options, Retry, Workflows

from pydantic_ai_harness import RenderWorkflows

app = Workflows()
workflows = RenderWorkflows(
    app,
    model_options=Options(
        retry=Retry(max_retries=3, wait_duration_ms=1_000),
        timeout_seconds=300,
        plan='flex',
    ),
    tool_options=Options(
        retry=Retry(max_retries=2, wait_duration_ms=1_000),
        timeout_seconds=120,
        plan='2c-4g',
    ),
)
```

To set the timeout for the whole agent run, replace `@workflows.task` above `support` with
`@workflows.task(timeout_seconds=600, plan='flex')`. Restart the local server and repeat step 4 to check that the
updated task still runs. These settings are fixed when tasks register and cannot change between invocations.

For per-tool configuration, see [Task options and tool opt-out](#task-options-and-tool-opt-out).

A failed child task can retry while the entry task waits. Retrying the entry task restarts `agent.run(...)`, so model
and tool calls that already finished may run again. There is no checkpoint resume or replay of completed steps.
The Render SDK also does not let this integration assign stable idempotency keys to child calls.
Either kind of retry can repeat an external action performed before its result was recorded; use application-level
idempotency keys or deduplication for writes and API requests that must not happen twice.

Render retries are separate from Pydantic AI's `ModelRetry`, which asks the model to correct or reconsider a call,
and from retries in the provider SDK. Account for all three when setting retry limits and timeouts; see the
[Pydantic AI retry guide](/ai/core-concepts/retries/).

## 7. Call the agent from Python

Your application can submit the same `support` task through the Render SDK. With the local task server still
running, save this as `submit.py` alongside `app.py`:

```python {title="submit.py" names="defined"}
import asyncio

from render import RenderAsync


async def main() -> None:
    client = RenderAsync()
    run = await client.workflows.start_task('support', ['Check the weather.'])
    print(run.id)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Run it in a second terminal:

```bash
py-cli env RENDER_USE_LOCAL_DEV=1 python submit.py
```

`RENDER_USE_LOCAL_DEV=1` directs the client to the local server without requiring a Render API key. The script
prints the run ID as soon as Render accepts the task, without waiting for the agent's answer.

To retrieve that run's status and result, save this as `check_run.py`:

```python {title="check_run.py" names="defined"}
import asyncio
import json
import sys

from render import RenderAsync


async def main() -> None:
    client = RenderAsync()
    run = await client.workflows.get_task_run(sys.argv[1])
    print(json.dumps(run.to_dict(), indent=2))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Pass the ID printed by `submit.py`:

```bash
py-cli env RENDER_USE_LOCAL_DEV=1 python check_run.py <RUN_ID>
```

Repeat the check while the run is pending or running. On success, the response has `status: "completed"` and the
agent's output in `results`; a failed run includes an `error`. With the unchanged test model, expect
`results: ["The workflow completed."]`.

For a FastAPI endpoint or another web application, use the `start_task` call in your request handler and return
`run.id` with HTTP `202 Accepted`. This avoids HTTP timeouts while a long-running LLM task finishes. Add a separate
status endpoint that calls `get_task_run` with that ID, so the browser or API client can check for the result.
Verify that the run belongs to the requesting user before returning its details, and keep Render credentials on
the server.

## 8. Deploy the agent to Render

Once the local example works, deploy the project as a [Workflow service](https://render.com/docs/workflows-tutorial#4-create-a-workflow-service).
Review the [JSON and dependency boundary](#json-and-dependency-boundary) and
[compatibility constraints](#pydantic-ai-compatibility-boundary) below, then:

1. Push the project and its dependency files to your Git provider. If you installed Harness from a local checkout,
   make that checkout available to the build through a repository-relative dependency, or use a published release
   that contains the integration. A path to a directory on your laptop will not exist on Render.
2. Create a Workflow service linked to that repository. Set its root directory to the folder containing `app.py`
   and its build command to install the project's dependencies. For a uv project whose dependencies are available
   in the build, use `uv sync --locked`.
3. Set the start command to `uv run render-workflows app:app` (`render-workflows app:app` for pip), and add the
   provider credentials, such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, to the Workflow's environment. Deploy and check that `support`
   appears in its task list.
4. In the application that submits tasks, set `RENDER_API_KEY` to a [Render API key](https://render.com/docs/api#1-create-an-api-key).
   Remove `RENDER_USE_LOCAL_DEV` and `RENDER_LOCAL_DEV_URL` if set, then replace `'support'` in `submit.py` with the
   deployed task's slug, such as `'my-workflow/support'`. Copy the actual slug from the task's Dashboard page.
5. Run `uv run python submit.py`, then `uv run python check_run.py <RUN_ID>` with its returned ID. With pip, use
   `python` in the activated environment. The same client calls now submit and inspect a hosted agent run.

Render's [task submission guide](https://render.com/docs/workflows-running) covers authentication and other ways
to trigger the deployed task.

## Task definitions and child task runs

The capability registers definitions for these operations:

- model requests, buffered stream requests, compaction, and suspended-response cleanup;
- per function toolset by default, or per statically known function tool when its resolved options differ, argument validation and tool calls;
- per MCP and dynamic toolset, discovery, instructions, validation, and calls;
- `event_stream_handler` delivery;
- each method another capability declares with `@durable_operation`.

Render's limit of 500 definitions per workflow counts the entry task and these generated definitions. Each definition
can produce many child runs, which Render schedules and bills individually.

## Task names for capability toolsets

Every registered leaf toolset needs a stable `id` because Render uses it in persisted task names. Duplicate IDs fail
Pydantic AI's uniqueness check; the integration does not rename them. An unnamed supported toolset attached directly
to an agent is rejected before any task definitions register.

Capability-owned toolsets can remain unnamed, in which case their tools execute inline in the entry task without
separate run records or task options. Pydantic AI has no public API for assigning an `id` after construction.

## Sub-agent delegation

`SubAgents` leaves its internal `delegate_task` toolset unnamed, so delegation itself stays inline in the workflow entry task. This preserves its parent-side `max_calls` check and event handling without assigning private Pydantic state.

To run a delegate's supported model and tool operations as Render task runs, construct that child `Agent` with its own `RenderWorkflows` instance using the same `Workflows` app as the parent. The app-scoped active `TaskContext` is then available to the explicitly configured child. Its model and named or agent-owned function tools register at construction and dispatch through `TaskContext.run()` during delegation. A child without `RenderWorkflows`, a child using another app, or a child built later from disk stays inline.

Successful operation results carry the child's usage delta and buffered custom or capability events in the versioned JSON envelope. The caller applies the delta once and re-emits events in order. Effects from a failed call or `ModelRetry` attempt are discarded. `SubAgent.max_calls` is enforced for concurrent delegations within the active parent task run because delegation stays in that process; it is not a global budget across retries or separate root task runs.

Immediate capability events require a synchronous decision before their emitter continues, which cannot be buffered across a child task. The integration rejects those events across the task boundary, so keep tools that emit them inline.

## Large tool outputs

`ToolOutputLimits` also contributes an unnamed helper toolset, so that helper remains inline. It measures and reduces a tool return after the registered tool task returns to the workflow entry task.

In `Spill` mode, the capability writes the full payload to a filesystem-backed store and gives the model a handle for a later `read_tool_result` call. Because task runs execute in separate processes and can have isolated filesystems, the later task might not be able to read the file behind that handle.

For large artifacts, return bounded JSON containing a key into object storage, a database, or another durable service that both tasks can reach. A later tool can then fetch the artifact from that shared store.

## Memory

Pass `Memory(...)` alongside `RenderWorkflows` in the agent constructor so its static toolset registers before execution. Each run resolves its own memory scope, with snapshot loading and memory tool calls executing in child tasks.

Use a `MemoryStore` backed by a shared external service that every task instance can reach. The default `InMemoryStore` is process-local; a local file or SQLite database is not shared across hosted task instances. A `store_resolver` and callable `namespace` must reconstruct the same scope from JSON dependencies in each worker.

## Task options and tool opt-out

Use Render `Options` for the model, tool, event, and capability task definitions:

```python {names="defined"}
from render import Options, Retry, Workflows

from pydantic_ai_harness import RenderWorkflows


def resolve_tool_options(_operation_id, _tool, tool_name):
    if tool_name == 'read_local_cache':
        return False
    return None


app = Workflows()
workflows = RenderWorkflows(
    app,
    model_options=Options(
        retry=Retry(max_retries=3, wait_duration_ms=1_000),
        timeout_seconds=300,
        plan='flex',
    ),
    tool_options=Options(timeout_seconds=120, plan='2c-4g'),
    event_options=Options(timeout_seconds=60),
    capability_options=Options(timeout_seconds=120),
    resolve_tool_options=resolve_tool_options,
)
```

At registration, the resolver first receives `tool=None` and `tool_name=''` to determine the toolset default.
It then receives each statically known function tool and its name; returning `None` keeps `tool_options`.

When every static tool resolves to the shared default, the toolset keeps its existing shared call and validation task definitions. When at least one resolves different `Options` or `False`, each eligible static tool receives definitions named from the agent, toolset, tool, and operation.

Returning `False` for a static function tool registers no task for that tool and runs it inside the workflow entry task. `False` is rejected for MCP and dynamic tools because their concrete tools are not known when the Workflow service registers definitions.

## JSON and dependency boundary

Because a child task can execute in a fresh process, the capability sends its inputs as a versioned JSON object and reconstructs the supported Pydantic AI state in that process.

Current callers write protocol v2, while workers also accept v1 requests and return effect-free v1 results that both old and new callers can read. This allows a new worker to finish work submitted by an older caller.

- Dependencies must round-trip through Pydantic's JSON codec. `deps_type` defaults to the agent's dependency type.
- Messages, model settings, metadata, tool definitions and arguments, usage deltas, buffered events, capability arguments, and results that cross the boundary must be JSON encodable.
- Render caps the total arguments of one task run at 4 MB ([additional limits](https://render.com/docs/workflows-limits#additional-limits)). The capability sizes the final JSON envelope and raises before dispatch rather than sending an oversized call.
- Live in-process objects are unavailable unless the reconstructed run context explicitly supports them.

## What Render retains

Everything that crosses the task boundary is task state that Render stores: prompts, model responses, tool arguments and results, dependencies, and operation metadata. Render keeps task state for 30 days and then deletes it (see [task state retention](https://render.com/docs/workflows-limits#task-state-retention)).

To keep API keys, tokens, and other credentials out of retained task state, read them from environment variables inside the child task rather than passing them through `deps`, tool arguments, or task results.

## Models and task-run lineage

Model instances are not serialized. A child task resolves the model ID in its inputs against the models registered in its own process: the agent's default model and any `models={...}` entries. It exposes that instance as `ctx.model` for tools and other capabilities that need it. This is the plain model, rather than the workflow-side wrapper, so calls through `ctx.model` stay in the current task. A plain-string default that each run resolves for itself has no registered instance, and `ctx.model` remains unavailable in a child task.

Render owns task-run lineage. This integration spawns children through `TaskContext.run()` and cannot assign `parentTaskRunId` or `rootTaskRunId` itself. Code that draws a run graph should read `rootTaskRunId` where the platform populates it, keep `parentTaskRunId` to work out depth, and page through every task-run listing. Where the root field comes back empty, scope the listing to the Workflow and walk parent links instead.

## Local runtime tests

The repository carries an opt-in test that drives the same local runtime end to end. It is skipped by default and needs the `render` CLI at version 2.28.0 or later, but no Render API key:

```bash
PYDANTIC_AI_HARNESS_RENDER_LOCAL_RUNTIME=1 uv run pytest tests/render/test_local_runtime.py
```

The nested-agent test registers entry, parent, child, and grandchild operations on a local Render server, then checks that one root run produces 12 completed operation runs parented to that root. It verifies JSON dependency transport, usage accounting, ordered event delivery within the run, and a `ModelRetry` across a grandchild tool boundary. The eight distinct process IDs include the test controller and the entry task.

A second case tests constructor-supplied Memory, reads and writes through separate task processes using a shared local SQLite fixture, and a custom `ctx.tracer` span reaching the tool worker's exporter. These tests cover the local runtime; they do not establish hosted storage sharing, failure recovery, or performance.

## Streaming and cancellation

The model child task consumes the provider stream and returns its completed response and captured events together.
The workflow-side agent delivers them after that task finishes, so provider tokens do not stream live across
`ctx.run(...)`. An `event_stream_handler` follows the same operation-task path.

Render task-run cancellation remains a native client and control-plane action. Pydantic AI cancellation tokens are unsupported inside a Render workflow because they are in-process handles. Suspended-model cleanup uses its own child task run. Neither form makes external tool side effects transactional.

## Execution and tracing

Render's synchronous and asynchronous clients submit ordinary tasks to its queues. To start the entry task on a
schedule, use a Render cron job.

The capability emits no additional OpenTelemetry spans. Pydantic AI's model and tool instrumentation continues to trace the agent operations, while Render records the child task runs, retries, logs, and metrics at the workflow boundary.

`ctx.tracer` is available inside child tasks. It is a no-op when tracing is disabled and otherwise uses the worker's Pydantic AI instrumentation settings, including `agent.instrument`, `Agent.instrument_all(...)`, and registered instrumented models. Configure instrumentation when each worker loads the app; tracer objects are not serialized. The caller's `trace_include_content` setting is preserved. This restores tool-local spans but does not propagate OpenTelemetry parent span context across `TaskContext.run`; those spans can be separate traces.

Resolving effective agent/global instrumentation currently uses a private Pydantic AI settings getter inside `_compat.py`, covered by the same version-compatibility tests as context reconstruction.

## Pydantic AI compatibility boundary

`RenderWorkflows` uses the public `BaseDurabilityCapability` and registered backend contracts. Pydantic AI does not yet publish every semantic parameter, transport, and bound-operation type needed by a cross-process registered backend. The integration contains those private imports in `pydantic_ai_harness/render/_compat.py`.

Changes to those private APIs can require a corresponding Harness update. Use Pydantic AI and Harness versions tested together, and run the Render integration tests before upgrading either dependency independently.
