"""The Logfire platform's own HTTP APIs, driven the way the Logfire UI drives them.

`AgentControl` never writes a variable: an agent reports its code baseline on an
`agent_control_config_hint` span and creating a config from that is a Logfire-side flow. So a suite
that wants a published config in play has to put one there the way the UI does, and that is what
this module is: `POST /v1/variables/` to create the config, `PUT /v1/variables/<name>/` to publish a
value per label, `DELETE` to remove it, and `GET /v1/query` to read the spans back out.

Two credentials, and they are not interchangeable:

- the **variables API key** (`project:read_variables` + `project:write_variables`) creates and
  publishes. The span write token cannot serve this API.
- the **read token** answers `GET /v1/query`, which is how a test proves a span *arrived* rather
  than that it was *emitted*. Agent Control itself never needs it.
