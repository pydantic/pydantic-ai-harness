"""Live Agent Control conformance tests against a running Logfire platform.

The unit suite in `tests/logfire_variables` drives `AgentControl` through a local variable provider
and test models. It answers whether the capability applies a config correctly. What it cannot answer
is whether the *feature* works, and that is what this file is for: a test that needs a published
config puts one in the project through the platform's own variables API, every test resolves through
the real Logfire SDK and makes a real model request, and each assertion reads what actually
happened -- the request the model was handed, the spans the process exported, or the platform's own
copy of one of them.

Eighteen claims, one or more tests each:

1. An unconfigured agent runs exactly as written, and reports that nothing resolved.
2. One `agent_control_config_hint` span per process carries every attribute it promises, and
   arrives at the platform.
3. The baseline describes the code, including the dynamic block's absent text.
4. The config can be created through the API the way the promote-a-hint flow will have to.
5. An instruction block can be replaced by `id`, whole or named, and nothing else moves.
6. An added block lands after the last static block.
7. A block can be dropped, and removing the config puts every code block back.
8. A renamed tool reaches the model under the managed name and the code under its own.
9. Tool and parameter descriptions reach the model; the parameter schema stays code-owned.
10. A published model overrides the code model, across providers.
11. Published settings patch over the code settings rather than replacing them.
12. A call-site `run(model=...)` beats the published model, which beats `Agent(model=...)`.
13. `on_unmatched` warns once per process, or fails the run naming every issue at once, or is silent.
14. A config section this release has never heard of is reported by name, and its siblings apply.
15. Neither an unparsable value nor an unreachable platform takes a run down.
16. Two labels on one variable, and each run reports the label and version it resolved.
17. A config is picked up once per run, so publishing mid-run takes effect on the next one.
18. A configured agent still reports its code baseline, marked `resolved`.

**This suite creates, publishes over and deletes variables on the project it is pointed at**, before
and after every test, because a conformance suite for a feature whose whole surface is stored state
has to own the state it checks. Every name it touches begins with the per-run
`agent__harness_agent_control_live_<8 hex>`, so the only config it can delete is one this run
created -- and it refuses to run at all without `LOGFIRE_PLATFORM_ALLOW_WRITES=1`. See `README.md`
for the rest, including how to bring a platform up and the two traps worth knowing about.

Unlike the three suites beside it, no CI job runs this one: those need one container each, and this
needs a whole Logfire platform. Run it by hand with `make integration-logfire-platform`.

The demo this was ported from ran every scenario in its own process, because three of the things
being checked are once *per process*: the hint span, an `on_unmatched` warning, and the resolved
config. Here `fresh_process_state` clears the first two guards between tests instead (the same two
`tests/logfire_variables/conftest.py` clears), and every test builds a new agent for the third.
