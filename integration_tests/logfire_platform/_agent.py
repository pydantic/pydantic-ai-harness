"""The agent this suite runs, and the probe that records what the model was actually shown.

Agent Control's central claim is that an agent's prompt is a composition and every piece of it is
separately addressable, so this agent has one instruction source of every kind Pydantic AI can key,
each labelled with the `id` a published config addresses it by:

| Where it is written                            | Block `id`                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `Agent(instructions=...)`                      | `agent`                   |
| `InstructionPart(name='escalation')` beside it  | `agent:escalation`        |
| `StorePolicy(id='store_policy')`, a capability | `capability:store_policy` |
| `FunctionToolset(id='orders', instructions=)`  | `toolset:orders`          |
| `FunctionToolset(id='catalog', instructions=)` | `toolset:catalog`         |
| `@agent.instructions(name='tenant')`           | `agent:tenant` (dynamic)  |

The tools live in two toolsets so the `toolset` qualifier on a published tool override is exercised
against a real second toolset rather than a hypothetical one. They have distinct names because
Pydantic AI advertises every tool into one namespace and refuses two toolsets offering the same one,
which is a fact about core rather than about this feature (`tests/logfire_variables` is where that
belongs).

`examples/agent_control.py` is the readable version of the same agent. This one is separate on
purpose: it carries the knobs the scenarios need (`label`, `on_unmatched`, a code-side model) and an
agent name no demo or deployment resolves, and the example stays free of test scaffolding.
