# CLAI 2 guide for AI code assistants

Read this before touching `pydantic-clai2/`. The repository-level `AGENTS.md`
still applies (no em-dashes, no `Any`, pyright strict, keyword-only arguments,
100% branch coverage). This file adds what is specific to the terminal shell.

## What CLAI is

A thin terminal around any Pydantic AI agent. It reads a prompt, runs the agent,
streams the answer, and repeats. Everything beyond that is a plugin, including
the default coding tools.

The three layers, and who owns what:

| Layer | Owns | Never does |
|---|---|---|
| Pydantic AI core | the agent loop, hooks, events, toolsets | know CLAI exists |
| `pydantic_ai_harness` | reusable capabilities (`Coder`, `Shell`, ...) | print to a terminal |
| `pydantic_clai2` | the prompt loop, rendering, `/commands`, plugin loading | reimplement a core hook |

If a change needs the agent loop to behave differently, propose it in core. If it
is a reusable behavior with no terminal in it, it belongs in harness. Only the
shell itself lives here.

## The plugin model

A plugin is a module with `activate(host: PluginHost)`, or a bare capability
class. `@host.on(name)` registers a handler for a lifecycle moment;
`@host.on(EventClass)` for a typed event; `host.commands.register` for a
`/command`; `host.add` for tools and instructions; `host.render` for custom
output; `host.settings(Model)` for validated config. `PLUGINS.md` is the user
contract. If code and `PLUGINS.md` disagree, fix one so they agree in the same PR.

## Rules for the plugin API

- **No global state.** Registration goes on a `PluginHost` instance someone
  constructed. No module-level dicts, no import-time side effects. Tests build a
  host and call `activate` directly.
- **Strings are keys, never payloads.** Hook names are a `Literal`; each name has
  an `@overload` binding one typed event dataclass. A handler never receives
  `*args`, `**kwargs`, `dict`, or `context: object = None`.
- **No string sub-dispatch.** A handler does not receive `event_type: str` and
  switch on it. Use the event class as the key.
- **One async spelling.** No `_sync` or `_async` pairs.
- **Observers return `None`.** Deciders mutate the event (`event.text = ...`,
  `event.cancel()`). Nothing collects a list of return values.
- **Fail closed, one way.** A raising handler on a decidable moment cancels the
  action and reports the error. No per-registration "fail open" flag.
- **Host hooks are `<subject>_<moment>`** (`turn_start`). Core hooks keep core's
  names verbatim (`before_tool_execute`). Do not rename a core hook for taste.
- **Payloads are kw-only dataclasses.** Not `BaseModel`. Pydantic is for the
  settings JSON boundary only.
- **No `getattr`/`hasattr` on a plugin** to discover what it supports. It
  registered the thing or it did not.
- **Only four host hooks.** `session_start`, `session_end`, `turn_start`,
  `turn_end`. Adding a fifth needs a use case that core cannot serve; say which
  core hook you checked and why it does not fit.

## Loading and unloading

Plugins load and unload while CLAI runs. The rules that make that safe:

- **One `PluginHost` per plugin.** The host is the ownership scope. Everything a
  plugin registers is recorded on its own host, so unloading is "discard this
  host". No `callback -> owner` map, no scanning registries for a plugin's name.
- **Load and unload only between turns.** `/commands` already run between turns,
  so this falls out for free; do not add a mid-run path.
- **Load fires `session_start` for that plugin; unload fires `session_end`.** A
  plugin cannot tell whether it was loaded at startup or later, and must not
  need to.
- **`reload` is unload, re-import, load.** Drop-in entry modules use fresh source.
  Installed modules use `importlib.reload`, which retains globals absent from the
  new source. Plugins must explicitly initialize their state on activation.
- **Registration is idempotent per name.** A capability is bound per run
  (`agent.run(capabilities=...)`), so "active for the next prompt" is the
  natural unit; nothing rebuilds the agent.
- **Built-ins are declarations, not code paths.** `DEFAULT_PLUGINS` in
  `_app.py` lists what CLAI ships enabled (`coder`, `compaction`). The loader treats them
  like drop-ins with the lowest precedence: a store declaration with the same
  id replaces one, `disable` persists an override, `remove` resets it. Do not
  special-case `Coder` anywhere else; the agent from `create_agent()` has no
  coding tools of its own.
- **A load failure leaves the session as it was.** Import or `activate` errors
  are reported and the plugin stays unloaded; partial registrations from a
  failed `activate` are discarded with the host.

## Adding or changing a hook

1. Add the name to the `Literal`, the event dataclass, and the `@overload`.
2. Add the parity test entry: the `Literal` must equal `Hooks.on`'s attribute
   names plus the host names. Drift fails CI, not code review.
3. Fire it from exactly one place in the shell.
4. Document it in `PLUGINS.md` in the table it belongs to.

## The `/plugins`, `/set`, and `/model` menus

Built on termflow's `MenuBuilder` (and `TextInputBuilder` for typed values),
exactly like Code Puppy's `/agent`, `/mcp`, `/set`, and `/model` menus:
alternate screen, a `.preview` panel on the right, `.on_key` for single-key
actions, `.footer_hint` for the key legend, `markdown_style()` for colours.

- Split it in two: a pure `build_plugins_menu(...)` that returns the menu (so
  tests drive it headless, no terminal), and a thin async runner that owns the
  screen and calls `menu.run` in a thread.
- Every key mutates immediately and `replace_items` redraws. No pending-changes
  state, no save/cancel pair.
- Nothing prints to the console while the menu is open; the alternate screen
  would hide it. Show empty states and errors inside the menu as disabled rows.
- Esc and Ctrl-C close cleanly. They are not errors.
- Adding a plugin is not in the menu. It needs free text, so it stays
  `/plugins add`.
- Anything that is "edit named, validated fields" uses `field_menu.py`: a
  `FieldSource` supplies rows, current values, validation, apply, and reset;
  `FieldMenu` builds the widgets; `run_flow` is the loop. `/set` and per-model
  settings are two sources, not two editors. Do not write a third editor.
- `/set` edits go through `CommandContext.set_setting` / `reset_setting`, the
  same path as the typed command, so validation lives in one place.
- Widget runners are a `Runners` value passed into the loops; tests pass
  scripted ones (`tests/menu_script.py`). Only the real `widget.run()`
  one-liners are `no cover`.
- Model sources live in `model_catalog.py`. To add one (models.dev, a provider
  API), write a function returning `CatalogModel`s and merge it in `catalog()`.
  The menu never talks to a source directly.
- Per-model settings are the editable subset of core's `ModelSettings`,
  declared once as `ModelSettingsForm` with descriptions and bounds. Extend the
  form, not the menu, to expose another setting.

## Rendering

`StreamRenderer` owns text and thinking. It knows nothing about any specific
tool. Tool-specific output (shell previews, diffs, grep) is registered through
`host.render` by the plugin that owns the event. Match on event classes, never
on `tool_name` strings. Always flush the stream before printing anything else;
the host does this for renderers, so do not call `console.print` from inside an
`on` handler when a renderer would do.

## Colours

Every colour comes from `theme.py`, which holds the Pydantic brand palette and
the roles CLAI paints with (`ACCENT`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `MUTED`,
`THINKING`). Use a role, not a hex, and never a bare Rich colour name like
`'cyan'` or `'dim'`. Raw ANSI surfaces (status line, splash) go through
`theme.sgr(...)`, which handles the 16-colour fallback. `theme.py` is stdlib
only because the splash imports it before anything heavy. Source of truth is
the pydantic.dev `pydantic-visual-identity` skill's `brand-identity.md`.

Keep files concise - we don't need any 10,000 line files. Single responsibility.

## Testing

- `pytest-anyio`; real model calls are blocked globally.
- Drive the shell with `TestModel` and a `Console(file=StringIO())`.
- Test a hook by building a `PluginHost`, registering a handler, and firing the
  event from the shell path that owns it. Assert the handler's effect (the
  cancelled turn, the rewritten text), not a mock call count.
- Renderers get synthetic events. They must not need `Coder` installed.
- Cancellation: use a real `anyio` cancel scope, order with `Event`s, no sleeps.

## Docs parity

`README.md` is the tour, `PLUGINS.md` is the plugin contract, this file is for
agents. A user-facing change updates the first two in the same PR. Plain
language, short sentences, no jargon a first-time plugin author would not know.
