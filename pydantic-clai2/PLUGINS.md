# CLAI plugins

A plugin is a Python file that teaches CLAI new tricks: react when something
happens, add a `/command`, give the agent a tool, or change how a tool's output
is shown on screen.

Everything a plugin can do goes through one object, the `PluginHost`. There is no
global registry to import and no magic file to name. You get a `host`, you tell it
what you want, you're done.

## On-demand authoring help

The default CLAI agent exposes `read_clai_customization_guide`. When you ask for
customization, its instructions tell it to read this guide first. Only the short
hint and tool description are present initially; the bundled text is read on tool
invocation. Reading it needs neither a checkout nor a network connection.

The [bundled guide](src/pydantic_clai2/customization.md) includes examples for
commands, hooks, settings, renderers, custom Termflow menus, and custom model
launchers. It also names current limits: PluginHost does not register providers,
replace the prompt editor, or alter the built-in model catalog. Those need a
custom agent launcher or a source change, as explained in the guide.

Custom agents can opt in with `customization_guide()` from
`pydantic_clai2.customization`. The tool only returns documentation; it does not
write files, activate plugins, or grant permission to execute generated code.
Keep the bundled guide aligned with this contract when changing plugin APIs.

## Credentials

CLAI's `/login openai-codex` and the vllm and openrouter connections store tokens
in the configured keyring backend, not plugin settings. Large token bundles use
multiple entries to fit Windows Credential Manager's size limit. When no keyring
backend exists, credentials go to a per-account `0600` file under the user's CLAI config
directory instead. None of this changes plugin APIs. See
[Codex authentication](README.md#codex-authentication) for storage and security
details.

## Where plugins live

Plugins are trusted Python code. Drop-in files execute automatically at startup;
this directory is an executable startup configuration, not a sandbox. The default
Coder runs as your OS user and can modify it, just as it can modify your shell
startup files. Use a separate OS identity or sandbox for untrusted agent work.

Two ways to install one:

1. Drop a `.py` file (or a package folder) into
   `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pydantic-clai2/plugins/` (default `~/.config/pydantic-clai2/plugins/`).
   Its name is the file name without `.py`.
2. Point CLAI at anything importable, from the shell or from inside CLAI:

   ```sh
   clai2 plugins add notify my_package.notify
   /plugins add coder pydantic_ai_harness.coder:Coder '{"unrestricted_filesystem": true}'
   ```

No restart needed when you do it from inside CLAI. A plugin you add or enable is
active for the next prompt; one you disable or remove is gone for the next
prompt. From the shell, `clai2 plugins ...` only saves; it loads on the next
start. Plugins in the folder and the ones you added by name are managed the
same way. Explicit module declarations take precedence over a same-named drop-in
file. Reloading a disabled plugin is rejected; enable it first. Drop-in entry
modules are compiled from current source. Installed modules use `importlib.reload`,
which can retain globals removed from source; initialize plugin state explicitly.

Plugins are trusted code running as you. Only install what you trust.

## The built-in plugins

The coding tools are a plugin too, and so are asking you multiple-choice
questions mid-run, reading the repository's instruction file, and keeping the
conversation inside the context window. `/plugins list` shows all four, marked
`(built-in)` and enabled unless you say otherwise:

| Id | Backed by | Settings | Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coder` | `pydantic_ai_harness.coder:Coder` | `{"unrestricted_filesystem": true, "repo_context": false}` | the file and shell tools |
| `ask_user` | `pydantic_clai2.ask_user_menu:activate` | `{}` | the `ask_user_question` tool: multiple-choice questions answered from the terminal |
| `repo_context` | `pydantic_clai2.repo_context` | `{}` | reads `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` from the launch directory into the instructions |
| `compaction` | `pydantic_clai2.compaction` | `{}` | automatic summarisation with a truncation fallback, `/compact`, and the context warning |

`/plugins disable coder` gives you a chat-only CLAI (a writing or research setup
with `ExaSearch` instead, say); `/plugins enable coder` brings the tools back;
`/plugins remove coder` cannot forget a built-in, so it resets it to its
defaults. `/plugins disable repo_context` stops the instruction file from being
read. To run a built-in with different options, add your own declaration under
the same name and it takes the built-in's place:

```text
/plugins add coder pydantic_ai_harness.coder:Coder '{"unrestricted_filesystem": false, "repo_context": false}'
/plugins add repo_context pydantic_clai2.repo_context '{"walk_up": true}'
```

Keep `"repo_context": false` on a replacement `coder`: `Coder` bundles its own
`RepoContext`, and with the `repo_context` plugin also on, the instruction file
would reach the model twice.

`repo_context` wraps harness `RepoContext` with the launch directory as the
workspace and its default filenames. Its settings:

| Key | Default | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `walk_up` | `false` | also load instruction files from every directory between the workspace and your home directory |
| `inventory_tool` | `false` | give the agent `inventory_agent_context`, which maps the repo's `.claude`, `.agents`, `.codex`, and `.grok` assets |
| `nested_traversal` | `false` | when the agent reads or lists a directory, tell it about that directory's instruction file |
| `nested_inject` | `"pointer"` | what nested traversal adds: `"pointer"` (one line naming the file) or `"contents"` |

A repository can declare plugins too, in `.clai/settings.json`; they show as
`(project)` and rank just above the built-ins. They start off, because a
repository must not run code as you just because you opened it: CLAI names the
ones waiting at startup, and `/plugins enable NAME` approves one. See
[Project settings](README.md#project-settings).

`compaction` directly registers harness `FallbackCompaction` with
`max_fraction=threshold`; harness owns the automatic trigger. `/compact` runs the
same chain unconditionally. Only `ModelAPIError`, `FallbackExceptionGroup`, and
`UsageLimitExceeded` cause summarisation to fall back to truncation; other exceptions
propagate. `/plugins disable compaction` turns automatic compaction,
`/compact`, and its context warning off; a declaration under the same name
changes its settings (`strategy`, `threshold`, `protected_tokens`,
`context_window`, `summarization_model`; see the README):

```text
/plugins add compaction pydantic_clai2.compaction '{"threshold": 0.7, "context_window": 200000}'
```

### `ask_user`: questions answered from the terminal

The second built-in, `ask_user` (`pydantic_clai2.ask_user_menu:activate`), gives
the model the harness's `AskUser` capability: one tool, `ask_user_question`, for
asking you one to ten multiple-choice questions when the task is ambiguous. Each
question opens a full-screen menu on the alternate screen: the options are the
rows, the right-hand panel shows the question and what the highlighted option
means, the title says `question 2 of 3` when there are several. Enter picks;
Space toggles on multi-select questions; Esc or Ctrl-C declines, which tells the
model you declined and lets the run continue. Streaming output is flushed and the
status row paused before the menu opens, and what you picked is printed to the
transcript afterwards. `/plugins disable ask_user` takes the tool away.

The capability does not know it is in a terminal. It hands an `AskUserRequest`
to an `Answerer` (one async callable returning an `AskUserResponse`) and waits.
To answer questions somewhere else, a web page or a chat bridge, say, replace
the built-in with your own plugin under the same name that constructs `AskUser`
with a different answerer:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.ask_user import AskUser, AskUserAnswer, AskUserRequest, AskUserResponse

from pydantic_clai2.plugins import PluginHost


async def ask_over_http(request: AskUserRequest) -> AskUserResponse:
    # POST request.questions to your front end, keyed by request.id, and wait
    # for the reply; return AskUserResponse(cancelled=True) if the user dismisses it.
    picks = [AskUserAnswer(header=q.header, selected=(q.options[0].label,)) for q in request.questions]
    return AskUserResponse(answers=tuple(picks))


def activate(host: PluginHost[None]) -> None:
    host.add(AskUser(answerer=ask_over_http))
```

```text
/plugins add ask_user my_ask_user
```

The request and its response are also emitted as `AskUserRequestedEvent` and
`AskUserAnsweredEvent`, so a plugin that only wants to watch (log the question,
show a "waiting for you" state) registers `@host.on(EventClass)` or
`@host.render(EventClass)` without being the answerer.

## Managing plugins

`/plugins` on its own opens a full-screen menu, the same kind Code Puppy uses
for `/agent` and `/mcp`:

```text
 Plugins

 [x] coder         pydantic_ai_harness.coder:Coder   | coder
 [x] notify        ~/.config/pydantic-clai2/plugins  | source  ~/.config/.../notify.py
 [ ] audit         my_package.audit                  | state   enabled, loaded
                                                     | adds    2 commands, 1 hook, 0 tools
                                                     | error   none

 Up/Down move - Space enable/disable - R reload - D remove - Enter/Q close
```

The left side lists every plugin with `[x]` for on and `[ ]` for off. The right
side shows details for the highlighted one: where it came from, whether it
loaded, what it registered, and the last error if loading failed. Every key
acts immediately; there is no save step, so Enter, Q, and Esc all just close.
Adding a plugin needs a name and a module, so that stays a typed command.

With arguments `/plugins` is a plain command, and `clai2 plugins ...` outside
CLAI does the same thing:

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/plugins list` | show every plugin and whether it is on |
| `/plugins add NAME module[:attr] [JSON]` | save it and load it now |
| `/plugins remove NAME` | forget an installed declaration; persistently disable a drop-in (delete its file yourself to remove it); reset a built-in or project-declared plugin to its declaration |
| `/plugins enable NAME` / `disable NAME` | load or unload, remembered across restarts |
| `/plugins reload NAME` | re-import the file and load it again (for editing a plugin while CLAI runs) |

What "load" and "unload" mean for your plugin:

- Load runs `activate(host)` and then fires `session_start` for that plugin, so a
  plugin loaded mid-session sees the same first event as one loaded at start.
- Unload fires `session_end` for that plugin, then drops everything it
  registered: handlers, commands, tools, renderers. Nothing else is touched.
- Both only happen between prompts, never while the agent is running.
- Python cannot truly forget a module. Reload re-imports it; if a plugin keeps
  state at module level, that state comes back fresh.

## The first plugin: give the agent web search

Pydantic AI Harness ships capabilities that are plugins as they are. `ExaSearch`
adds `web_search` and `get_page` tools backed by [Exa](https://exa.ai). Install
the extra and set the key, then add the class by name:

```sh
pip install 'pydantic-ai-harness[exa]'
export EXA_API_KEY=...
```

```text
/plugins add exa pydantic_ai_harness.exa:ExaSearch '{"num_results": 8}'
```

The JSON is passed to the constructor, so any keyword `ExaSearch` accepts that
JSON can express works here; an option that takes a Python object, like
`client`, needs the file form below. Ask the agent something that needs the web on the next prompt and it has
the tools. `/plugins disable exa` takes them away again.

The same thing as a plugin file, `~/.config/pydantic-clai2/plugins/search.py`,
which is the shape to start from when you want more than one capability, or a
`/command`, or a hook alongside it:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.exa import ExaSearch

from pydantic_clai2.plugins import PluginHost


def activate(host: PluginHost) -> None:
    host.add(ExaSearch(num_results=8, text_summary=True))
```

A plugin module exposes one function, `activate(host)`. CLAI calls it once when
the plugin loads. Everything you register inside it stays until the plugin is
unloaded or CLAI quits. Any Pydantic AI capability goes through `host.add`, so
`YouSearch` from `pydantic_ai_harness.youdotcom`, core's `WebSearch`, or one you
wrote yourself all work the same way.

`module:attr` may also name a function that takes a host, if you prefer a name
other than `activate`.

## Reacting to a moment

Plugins are not only for tools. This one rings the terminal bell when a turn
finishes, so you can tab away during a long run:

```python
from pydantic_clai2.plugins import PluginHost, TurnEnd


def activate(host: PluginHost) -> None:
    @host.on('turn_end')
    async def ping(event: TurnEnd) -> None:
        host.console.bell()
```

## What you can register

### React to a moment: `@host.on(name)`

`name` is a string. Your editor autocompletes it, and the type checker knows what
`event` your handler receives for each name. A typo is an error, not silence.
`host.on` is always used as a decorator.

Four names belong to CLAI itself. They fire outside the agent run, in the shell:

| Name | When | Event fields | Can change things? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `session_start` | CLAI has started, before the first prompt | `agent`, `settings` | no |
| `session_end` | CLAI is quitting | `reason`: `exit`, `eof`, or `error` | no |
| `turn_start` | you pressed Enter on a prompt | `text` | yes: edit `event.text`, or `event.cancel()` |
| `turn_end` | the turn finished, failed, or was interrupted | `text`, `outcome`, `result`, `error` | no |

Ctrl-C during an agent run keeps the prompt and captured partial messages in
conversation history for the next turn. Cancellation still reaches the running
tools for cleanup; it does not undo completed side effects or retry the run.
A prompt cancelled by `turn_start` never starts an agent run and is not retained.

Every other name is a Pydantic AI lifecycle hook, spelled exactly as on core's
`Hooks().on`, with the same handler signature. The ones people reach for:

| Name | When |
|---|---|
| `before_run` / `after_run` | an agent run starts / finishes |
| `before_model_request` | just before the model is called; you can edit the request |
| `before_tool_execute` | a tool is about to run; raise to stop it |
| `after_tool_execute` | a tool has returned |
| `tool_execute_error` | a tool raised |
| `event` | every stream event; prefer `@host.on(EventClass)` below |

The full list and every signature are in the
[hooks reference](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/core-concepts/hooks/). Core's
`wrap_*` and `on_*_error` methods drop their prefix here (`run`, `tool_execute`,
`run_error`), matching `Hooks().on`.

### React to a typed event: `@host.on(EventClass)`

Tools and capabilities emit typed events (a shell started, a file was written).
Pass the class instead of a string:

```python
from pydantic_ai import RunContext
from pydantic_ai_harness.filesystem import FileWrittenEvent
from pydantic_clai2.plugins import PluginHost


def activate(host: PluginHost[None]) -> None:
    @host.on(FileWrittenEvent)
    async def log_write(ctx: RunContext[None], event: FileWrittenEvent) -> None:
        host.console.print(f'wrote {event.path}')
```

Some events let you say no. If the event has a `cancel()` method, calling it stops
the action before it happens (for example `FileChangeRequestEvent`).

### Add a `/command`: `host.commands.register(...)`

```python
from pydantic_clai2.commands import Command

host.commands.register(
    Command(
        name='greet',
        description='Say hello',
        handler=lambda args: 'Hello ' + (' '.join(args) or 'there'),
    )
)
```

The handler gets the arguments as a list of strings and returns the text to show.
It may be `async`. Add `complete=` to offer Tab suggestions. Names must be unique;
clashing with a built-in is an error at startup, not a silent override.

### Give the agent tools or instructions: `host.add(capability)`

```python
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import Capability

tools = Capability(instructions='Prefer British spelling.')


@tools.tool_plain
def word_count(text: str) -> int:
    return len(text.split())


host.add(tools)
```

`host.add` also accepts a function that takes a `RunContext` and returns a
capability (or `None`), for tools that should only exist in some runs.

### Draw an event yourself: `@host.render(EventClass)`

Built-in tool rendering shows one summary line per call by default, clipped to
the terminal width. Shell output and completion details, grep results, and file
diffs are hidden from the terminal, not from the model. Set
`/set display.tool_output true` to restore detailed output; `display.shell_lines`
and `display.grep_lines` then control preview lengths (20 lines each by default).
This setting does not suppress plugin renderers or interactive questions.

CLAI shows unknown tool calls as a dim `● tool_name`. To show something
better, return a Rich renderable (a `str` is fine). Return `None` to say "not mine,
use the default".

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.filesystem import FileWrittenEvent
from pydantic_clai2.plugins import PluginHost


def activate(host: PluginHost[None]) -> None:
    @host.render(FileWrittenEvent)
    def show_write(event: FileWrittenEvent) -> str:
        return f'wrote {event.path}'
```

CLAI flushes any streaming text before it prints what you return, so your output
never lands in the middle of a paragraph.

### Take the whole screen mid-run: `async with host.full_screen()`

A full-screen widget opened from inside a tool call (the built-in `ask_user` menu
is one) has to wait for streamed text to finish and the status row to get out of
the way, or it draws over half a paragraph and the footer keeps repainting into
it. `host.full_screen()` does both and undoes them when the block exits:

```python
from pydantic_clai2.plugins import PluginHost


async def choose(host: PluginHost[None]) -> str:
    async with host.full_screen():
        return await show_my_menu()
```

Between turns nothing is streaming, so it is a no-op there. It only settles the
screen; drawing, and restoring the terminal afterwards, is the widget's job. One
widget owns the screen at a time: a second `full_screen()` (from a parallel tool
call, say) waits for the first block to exit. Do not nest it inside itself.

### Read your settings: `host.settings(Model)`

The JSON passed to `plugins add` is validated against a model you define:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel


class NotifySettings(BaseModel):
    sound: bool = True


settings = host.settings(NotifySettings)
```

Bad or missing values fail at startup with a message naming your plugin.

### Reach the conversation and the status row: `host.conversation`, `host.status`

`host.conversation` is the retained history: `messages` is a snapshot,
`replace_messages(...)` swaps it between turns, and `resolved_model()` is the
model the next prompt will use. `host.status` is the footer's state; set
`context_alert` to paint the context figure in the warning colour. The built-in
`compaction` plugin uses both. A host built outside the shell gets an in-memory
`Transcript` and a detached `Status`, so tests need no special case.

## Rules that keep plugins predictable

- Handlers are `async`. There is no sync variant of anything.
- CLAI host observers return `None`. Core hooks keep their exact core return
  contracts: for example `before_model_request` must return its `ModelRequestContext`.
  For cancelable host events, edit the event or call `event.cancel()`.
- Raising in `turn_start` prevents the turn. Raising in core `before_tool_execute`
  fails the agent run, not only that tool. Use core's documented tool-denial
  mechanisms when the model should recover instead of ending the run, such as
  `pydantic_ai.exceptions.SkipToolExecution` for skipping an individual tool.
- Startup plugins load in alphabetical ID order. CLAI host handlers run in
  activation order, while `/plugins list` remains alphabetical. Core hook ordering
  follows core composition, including reverse order for `after_*` hooks. The first renderer that returns something wins. A
  plugin loaded later goes to the end of the line.
- Anything you print, print through `host.console`, so it stays in step with
  streaming output.

## Testing a plugin

`PluginHost` is an ordinary object. Build one with a `Console` writing to a
`StringIO`, call your `activate`, then call the handlers you registered with
hand-made events. No terminal, no model, no network.

```python
from io import StringIO

from rich.console import Console

from pydantic_clai2.plugins import PluginHost, TurnEnd

host = PluginHost(name='notify', console=Console(file=StringIO()), settings={})
activate(host)
for handler in host.handlers:
    await handler(TurnEnd(text='hi', outcome='completed'))
```

A plugin that reads the history gets a `Transcript` by default; pass
`conversation=Transcript(messages=[...], model=TestModel())` to seed it.

## vllm connection

Open `/add_model`, choose `vllm`, then enter a trusted HTTP(S) server root or `/v1` URL, and optionally a token. CLAI queries `/v1/models` and opens a searchable model picker. HTTP sends tokens unencrypted; use HTTPS outside trusted local networks.

## openrouter connection

Open `/add_model`, choose `openrouter`, then choose **Sign in with browser** or **Enter API key**. Browser sign-in opens OpenRouter's [PKCE authorization flow](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/oauth-pkce) and receives an authorization code on a temporary loopback listener. CLAI exchanges the code for a user-controlled API key over HTTPS. If the browser cannot reach CLAI (for example over SSH), paste the final callback URL or authorization code into the terminal. If no browser opens, open the printed authorization URL manually. Login times out after five minutes; Ctrl-C cancels it. You can revoke the generated key on OpenRouter.

Manual entry still accepts a key from https://openrouter.ai/keys in a masked prompt. After either method, select a model from the live catalog. CLAI validates the key with `/api/v1/key` before fetching `/api/v1/models`. Cancelling before model selection leaves the saved connection unchanged.

The connection is saved in the configured Python keyring backend after selection; backend security depends on your keyring configuration. Tokens are not stored in SQLite or command history. The selected model persists across restarts. Select the provider again to browse its live models or reconfigure the saved connection. Discovery is explicit and has a 20-second network timeout; redirects are not followed. Agent inference uses Pydantic AI core.


## Saved API keys

Open `/keys` to browse and manage saved API keys in a full-screen menu.
Use A to add, Enter to replace a value, R to rename, and D to delete with
confirmation. Values are masked and are not shown in previews. Changes save
immediately; Esc or Ctrl-C closes the menu. Errors appear inside the menu.

The compatibility command `/set api_key` prompts for a name and masked API key. Names are trimmed
and uppercased automatically, so `my_vllm_key` becomes `MY_VLLM_KEY`. Use letters,
numbers, and underscores, starting with a letter or underscore. Saving an existing
name asks before replacing it. Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D cancels without saving. Do not put
the secret on the command line.

When saved keys exist, vLLM's token prompt and OpenRouter's **Enter API key** flow
show a searchable list of names. Choose one, enter a different key privately, or
choose **No API key** for vLLM. Esc closes the picker without connecting. Browser
login flows are unchanged. Select keys only for endpoints you trust.

Named keys use the existing credential backend, separate from provider logins and
SQLite settings. If no OS keyring exists, CLAI warns that it saved them in the
per-user `0600` plaintext file `credentials-api-keys.json` in its config directory.
Key values never appear in the picker or confirmation. Names are labels, not
exported environment variables. Selecting a saved key stores a reference, not a copy. Discovery and each new
turn resolve its current value. Replacing a key updates connections that reference
it. Deleting it makes those connections fail until you restore the same name or
reconfigure them. Keys referenced by saved connections cannot be renamed. A cross-process lock
serializes key changes and connection saves so concurrent CLAI sessions do not
overwrite each other's key edits. The lock file contains no credentials.

Existing connections with inline credentials, manually entered connection keys,
and browser logins remain unchanged. To switch an existing connection to a
reference, reconfigure it through `/add_model` and select a saved key. Changes do not
alter an already running request or revoke credentials at the provider.

### Adding and selecting models

`/add_model` opens the provider catalog, connection setup, and per-model settings.
`/add_model PROVIDER:NAME` adds a model directly. Adding a model also selects it
for the next prompt. `/model` is a flat picker of added models, and `/model NAME`
selects one without the menu. Its Tab suggestions contain only added models.
The list persists across sessions. The currently configured model is retained
when upgrading; `/set model NAME` also saves the model in this list.
