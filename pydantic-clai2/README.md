# CLAI 2.0

A separately installable terminal client for Pydantic AI. The coding tools,
`Coder(unrestricted_filesystem=True)`, are the built-in `coder` plugin: on by
default, `/plugins disable coder` for a chat-only shell. The model can also ask
you multiple-choice questions mid-run through the built-in `ask_user` plugin;
see [Questions from the model](#questions-from-the-model). The built-in
`repo_context` plugin reads `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` from the launch directory
into the agent's instructions; `/plugins disable repo_context` turns that off.
Context management is the built-in `compaction` plugin,
[described below](#compacting-the-conversation).
The `/plugins` menu also lists every other harness capability, disabled by
default. Press Space to enable one. Some need optional packages, credentials,
or constructor settings first; see [optional harness capabilities](PLUGINS.md#optional-harness-capabilities).
Python 3.11+ is required by Termflow. Tracking issue: https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/issues/875.

CLAI file tools can access paths outside the workspace, including `/tmp`, and do
not protect secret files or repository metadata. OS permissions still apply.
Relative paths use the launch workspace. Use a custom agent with `Coder()` to
retain workspace-scoped file tools.

Tool calls show a single-line summary followed by a blank line by default.
Tool names are pink; their arguments and bullet markers are muted grey. Shell output, exit details and
log paths, grep results, and file diffs stay out of the terminal; the model still
receives full tool results. Long summaries are clipped to the terminal width.
Use `/set display.tool_output true` to show detailed output again, or
`/set display.tool_output false` to return to summaries. In detailed mode,
`display.shell_lines` and `display.grep_lines` limit previews to 20 lines by
default. Plugin-provided rendering, including interactive questions, is unchanged.

## Code highlighting

Fenced code uses the fence's language for syntax highlighting. CLAI renders a
block when its closing fence arrives, or when the text part ends if the fence
is unfinished. This keeps multiline strings and comments correctly colored.
Prose outside fences still streams line by line. Unlabelled and Markdown fences
stay literal, including indentation and blank lines; unknown languages use plain
text. Long code lines wrap to the terminal width.

## Interrupting a turn

Press Esc or Ctrl-C to cancel the active agent turn without discarding your draft.
Tool cleanup finishes before the next queued message starts. Esc does not request
exit, even when pressed repeatedly. Arrow keys and Alt-key shortcuts keep their
editing behavior. The active full-screen interface retains control of Esc rather
than passing it to the agent turn; its behavior depends on that interface.
After cancelling with Ctrl-C, press Ctrl-C again within two seconds to exit,
including across the transition back to input. Esc does not arm this exit shortcut.
At the prompt,
the first press clears input and the second exits. Ctrl-D on an empty input and
`/exit` also quit after earlier queued messages finish.
The interrupted prompt and captured partial responses and tool results stay in
conversation history, so you can follow up with a clarification. No interrupted
run is automatically retried. Unanswered tool calls in retained failed or
interrupted turns are closed out by core on the next prompt, without replaying
those tools. External application cancellation still propagates, and completed
tool side effects cannot be undone.

## Prompt area

```text
Follow-up: Add tests for the change
Command: /usage
┌─ Working ⠋ ──────────────────────────────────┐
│> Draft your next message here                 │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
model | context: ... | running: shell
```

The prompt sits above the footer with one editable line when empty. It grows
for wrapped or pasted text and completion suggestions, not to fill the terminal.
History search stays compact too. The bordered prompt area stays visible below
streamed output while CLAI works, and remains editable. A `Working` label and
animated spinner appear in the box's top border while a turn or its lifecycle
hooks are active, without adding a row to the input area. The animation uses the editor's existing refresh
cycle and disappears when work finishes, fails, or is cancelled. It is not part
of your draft or submitted message. Output bursts are batched; terminals supporting
synchronized output display new output and the restored input box together.
Partial streaming text and spinner refreshes use the same synchronization,
so intermediate redraws are not presented as separate frames. Full-screen menus temporarily hide it along
with the editor. Enter submits a message to an in-memory queue. Pending text appears above the editor as `Follow-up:`
previews, with queued slash commands labeled `Command:`. Previews are shown in
execution order and disappear as each submission starts. Long or multiline messages
have a single-line preview; large queues show a `+N more queued` summary to leave
room for the editor. The original message text is unchanged. The footer also shows
the number waiting. This is a read-only preview, not a queue editor.

Messages and slash commands run in submission order, after the current turn and its cleanup
finish. They do not interrupt or steer the active turn. An unsubmitted draft stays
in the editor as turns finish. Queued messages are not saved as conversation turns
until execution starts, and are discarded on exit or `/reload`.

Full-screen question menus and slash-command menus temporarily take over input.
The editor and its draft return when the menu closes.
Small terminals omit the border to leave room for output.

## Pasting images

Copy a screenshot or image, then press **Ctrl-V** in CLAI to attach it. If your
terminal intercepts Ctrl-V, use **Alt-V** (or press Esc, then V). On macOS, Cmd-V
is the terminal's text paste, not CLAI's clipboard-image shortcut.

You can also paste or drag local image file paths into the prompt. This requires
the terminal's bracketed-paste support. A paste containing only existing image
paths becomes attachments; ordinary pasted text stays text. Quoted paths and
paths containing spaces are supported. UNC and device paths are not read. PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, and TIFF files
are read locally and converted to PNG (the first frame of animated images).

Each image appears as `[image:...]`. Add your question and press Enter, or submit
the image alone. Delete a marker before submitting to remove that attachment.
Images in queued follow-ups belong to that follow-up, not the running turn.
Paste errors appear in the footer without submitting a message or losing the draft.

Clipboard access uses Pillow's native Windows and macOS backends. On Linux,
install `wl-clipboard` for Wayland or `xclip` for X11 and run inside that graphical
session. SSH and headless sessions generally cannot read your local desktop
clipboard; paste a path to an image accessible on the machine running CLAI instead.
The clipboard is read only when you invoke the image shortcut.

Use a model that accepts images. CLAI sends the image bytes to the selected model;
provider-specific size and format restrictions can still apply. Each source file
and encoded attachment is limited to 10 MiB and 25 megapixels, with 32 MiB of
pending image bytes. Accepted images are saved with the conversation and restored
by `/resume`. Input recall stores markers, not image bytes: paste the image again
if you recall an expired marker. If submission is rejected because no model is
selected, the most recently rejected prompt keeps its attachments for retry. Unsubmitted images are discarded on exit or reload.

Pillow is a terminal-only dependency; see the CLAI dependency boundary in
[#875](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/issues/875).

## Input history

Submitted prompts and slash commands persist across restarts for Up/Down recall,
including multiline input. They are stored as plaintext in `input-history` next
to `config.db`: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pydantic-clai2/input-history`, or
`~/.config/pydantic-clai2/input-history` by default. On POSIX the file is restricted
to its owner (mode 0600). Avoid entering secrets in the prompt: input history is
not encrypted. Delete this file while CLAI is closed to clear saved input.
`/new` starts a new saved conversation, without deleting the previous one or
input recall. Model responses and tool results are not saved to this file.

## CI coverage

The `CLAI coverage` check combines branch coverage from Python 3.11 and 3.14
and requires 100% for `src/pydantic_clai2`. It is separate from Harness coverage;
passing CLAI test jobs alone does not mean either coverage gate has passed.
Tracked under [#875](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/issues/875).

## Start chatting

Launch `clai2`. The default model is `openai-codex:gpt-6-astra`.
Run `/login openai-codex` to connect your ChatGPT/Codex subscription.
Type `/set model ` and press Tab to pick another provider-qualified model name.
The choice is saved in SQLite and used for the next prompt without restarting.

From a source checkout, launch with `uv run --project pydantic-clai2 clai2`.

For API-key providers, set the provider's API key environment variable before starting.
Codex uses subscription OAuth instead, not `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The default Coder
can read and modify files and execute commands with your user permissions. Run it
in a workspace you trust. CLAI does not add a sandbox or approval layer.

The startup splash adapts Code Puppy's stdlib-only, alternate-screen Pydantic
pyramid, with CLAI lettering. The persistent `CLAI 2.0` banner uses `ansi_shadow`.
The splash is disabled for redirected output, CLI arguments, small terminals,
Windows, `NO_COLOR`, or `CLAI_NO_SPLASH=1`.

## Codex authentication

`/login openai-codex` opens the browser and uses core's `OpenAICodexOAuthFlow`:
authorization code with PKCE, state validation, and a callback at
`http://localhost:1455/auth/callback`. It times out after five minutes.

If the browser cannot reach that callback on the machine running CLAI (for
example over SSH), the redirect fails in the browser. Copy the URL from the
address bar and paste it at the prompt CLAI shows under the login link; the bare
`code` value works too. CLAI checks the URL's `state` against the current login
before exchanging the code. Whichever arrives first, the callback or the paste,
completes the login.

Tokens live in the configured Python `keyring` backend under service `pydantic-clai2`,
not in SQLite or `~/.codex/auth.json`. Large token bundles are split across keyring
entries to fit Windows Credential Manager's per-entry size limit. Existing
single-entry logins remain readable. Choose an OS-backed credential store: CLAI
uses the configured backend and does not enforce its encryption or storage policy.
Installing or selecting a plaintext backend can store tokens in plaintext. Core owns
token refresh through CLAI's `OpenAICodexCredentialSource`. Tests mock keyring,
the browser, and OAuth exchange and do not access real credentials.

When no keyring backend exists at all (keyring raises `NoKeyringError` or
`InitError`, typical on a headless Linux box or over SSH), credentials go to a
`0600` file in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pydantic-clai2/` (`~/.config/pydantic-clai2/` by
default) instead, named for the account: Codex uses `credentials-openai-codex.json`,
and the vllm and openrouter connections use their own files. Like keyring entries,
these files are per user, so `--database PATH` does not move them. `/login` says so in its confirmation. A locked keyring is not treated as
missing; unlock it instead. Once a keyring becomes available, the next login or
token refresh moves the credentials there and deletes the file.

The default Coder shell runs under your OS identity, without a sandbox. Commands
can read files and access credential backends available to that identity, including
CLAI's tokens. Keyring is storage, not isolation from model-controlled commands.
Use a separate OS account or isolated environment for untrusted repositories.

The requested default does not guarantee model availability for a subscription.
Custom agents supplied to `chat` retain their model unless settings explicitly
select an override. `/login` is async, and plugin command handlers may also return
an awaitable string.

## Settings and commands

Preferences live in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pydantic-clai2/config.db`, falling back to
`~/.config/pydantic-clai2/config.db`. Use `--database PATH` to select another database.
A repository can add its own layer with a `.clai/settings.json` file; see
[Project settings](#project-settings). Conversation messages and CLAI's
Codex tokens are not written to the settings database. Plugin settings are arbitrary
JSON stored in plaintext in this database, including secrets if you put them there.
Pass secret references or use plugin-owned credential storage instead of embedding keys.

```text
/set
/set model <Tab>
/set display.thinking false
/set run.request_limit 10000
/set run.tool_retries 3
```

`/set` on its own opens a full-screen menu, the same kind Code Puppy uses: the
settings on the left, details for the highlighted one on the right (current
value, default, what it does). Type to filter. Enter edits: booleans and the
model get a picker (the model list is searchable, with "Type a value..." for
anything not listed), everything else a typed input that validates as you go.
An empty value resets. `R` resets the highlighted setting. Esc closes. Every
edit saves and applies immediately, the same as `/set KEY VALUE`.

`run.tool_retries` sets the default retry budget per tool call, starting at `3`.
Use a non-negative integer; `0` disables retries. Changes apply to the next turn.
Explicit per-tool or per-toolset retry limits take precedence. This setting does
not change output-validation or HTTP transport retries.

## Models and their settings

`/model` selects from models you have already added. Its flat, searchable picker
and Tab completion use only that saved list. `/model NAME` switches directly to
an added model. The currently configured model is kept in the list when upgrading.

`/add_model` opens a searchable provider list, then a model picker for that provider.
Esc from the model list returns to providers. Providers are unique prefixes from
the merged catalog, including `openai-codex`. Its suggestions include
`gpt-5.6-luna`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, and `gpt-6-astra`; availability
depends on your account. Unknown prices and context limits are not inferred.

The model catalog combines genai-prices' catalog
filtered to providers Pydantic AI can run, plus core's own model list, plus
whatever you have set now. The left side shows model names and marks the current
model; token counts stay in the details. The right side shows the provider, context window,
prices, and any settings you have saved for that model. Type to filter. Enter
saves it in your model list and makes it the model for the next prompt. `Ctrl+S` opens that model's settings:
`max_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `seed`, `timeout`, the two
penalties, `parallel_tool_calls`, `thinking`, and `service_tier`. They are
saved per model and passed to every run with that model. Unsupported settings
may be ignored or rejected by the provider; select only settings your provider supports. `/add_model NAME` sets the model without the menu.

For `/set` and `/add_model`, Tab completes setting names, boolean values, and model names from Pydantic AI's
built-in catalog without network access. Provider prefixes include `openai-codex:`,
which core supports but does not currently include in that model catalog. Complete
the provider prefix, then enter the model identifier; suggestions do not establish
subscription availability. Custom model identifiers are accepted too.

The command registry uses Termflow's `Completer`, `Document`, and `Completion`
types. The current input widget and popup still use prompt-toolkit through a small
adapter; replacing that editor with a Termflow-based editor is separate work.
`/set SETTING` shows its current value. `/set` changes apply to subsequent prompts
and preserve conversation history; splash changes apply at next startup.

Precedence is defaults, SQLite overrides, the project file, `CLAI_MODEL`, then
explicit CLI flags. Settings are validated before writes. `/set` updates the
active settings snapshot; legacy `/config` writes apply on restart; plugin
changes apply on the next prompt. `--request-limit` controls the full prompt's
model-request budget.

## Project settings

A repository can pin settings for everyone who runs CLAI inside it. Put a
`.clai/settings.json` next to the code; CLAI looks for one in the launch
directory and each parent, stopping at the first directory that contains
`.git`, and uses the nearest file it finds. Nothing is loaded from above the
repository.

```json
{
  "model": "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6",
  "thinking": false,
  "request_limit": 50,
  "plugins": [
    {"id": "exa", "factory": "pydantic_ai_harness.exa:ExaSearch", "settings": {"num_results": 8}},
    {"id": "repo_context", "factory": "pydantic_clai2.repo_context", "settings": {"inventory_tool": true}}
  ]
}
```

The keys are the field names from `/config show` (`model`, `request_limit`,
`thinking`, `splash`, `shell_lines`, `grep_lines`, `smooth_seconds`) and are
validated the same way as `/set`. A bad value stops startup with the file name
and the problem; a key CLAI does not know is reported once at startup and
ignored, so a newer file still works with an older CLAI. Precedence, lowest
first: defaults, your user settings, the project file, `CLAI_MODEL`, CLI flags.

`plugins` takes the same declarations as `/plugins add`: an `id`, a `factory`
(`module` or `module:attr`), an optional `path`, and optional `settings`. A
repository cannot switch a plugin on for you: plugins are trusted code running
as your user, so every project-declared plugin starts off, CLAI lists the ones
waiting at startup, and `/plugins enable NAME` is your approval. Approval is
remembered in your user settings together with the declaration you approved,
so a later change to the repository's declaration does not run until you
`/plugins remove NAME` (which forgets your approval and restores the project's
current declaration, off) and enable it again. Project declarations rank just
above the built-ins: a project may redeclare `coder` or `repo_context` with
other options, and that replacement is also off until you enable it.

The project file is read-only from inside CLAI. `/set KEY VALUE` writes your user
settings and applies for the current session; `/config set` writes your user
settings and applies on restart. Either way the project value returns at the
next start. In the `/set` menu a value the project
sets carries a muted `project` mark after it, and the details panel names the
origin. CLAI prints the file it found when it starts.

`AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` in the launch directory is read automatically by the
built-in `repo_context` plugin (harness `RepoContext`), which is separate from
the project file. `/plugins disable repo_context` turns it off, for this and
every later session; `/plugins enable repo_context` brings it back. See
[PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md#the-built-in-plugins) for its settings.

Interactive commands: `/login`, `/set`, `/model`, `/add_model`, `/help`, `/new`, `/resume`, `/exit`, `/config`,
`/plugins`, `/reload`, `/usage`, `/cost`, and `/compact` from the built-in `compaction` plugin.
Tab completion suggests commands, settings, boolean values, plugin identifiers,
and paths after `@`. Path completion inserts a path; it does not attach file contents.
Unknown command-shaped input such as `/missing` still reports an error instead
of reaching the model. Absolute paths such as `/Users/me/Desktop/Screenshot.png`
are prompts, not commands: a slash, dot, or backslash in the first token after
`/` marks path-like input. Quoted paths are also prompts. For an ambiguous
single-component path with spaces, quote it, for example `"/Screen Shot.png"`.
This routing handles path text that the editor has not converted to an attachment.
After trimming surrounding whitespace, that text, including internal spaces and
shell escapes, reaches the agent unchanged. Routing alone does not read the file;
the agent's configured tools determine how it can access it. Separately, bracketed
paste of existing image paths creates attachments as described in
[Pasting images](#pasting-images).

Up/down recall saved prompt history. Ctrl-D exits. Ctrl-C at input clears the line; during a run it cancels
the turn and returns to input. No cancelled run is automatically retried.

## Reload CLAI during development

```text
/reload
```

After editing `pydantic_clai2` source, run `/reload` without arguments. It uses
`importlib.reload` on loaded CLAI modules and rebuilds the prompt loop, commands,
and session with the updated code. The Python process, agent, dependencies passed
to `chat`, conversation messages, selected model, and active settings are kept.
Enabled plugins unload and activate again so their handlers use the refreshed
shell types. Disabled and unapproved project plugins stay off.

If an import or shell rebuild fails, CLAI reports the error and restores the
previous module bindings. Correct the source and retry `/reload`. Plugin hosts
and their registrations are recreated. Installed module globals not overwritten
by the new source can survive; initialize mutable state in `activate`.
Import-time side effects cannot be undone.

Reload ordering follows module-scope imports in the current Python source, so
adding or changing imports between CLAI modules does not require a restart.
Newly referenced local modules and package initializers are included when planning
the dependency order, but Python imports them only if the updated code uses them.
Function-local imports and `TYPE_CHECKING` guards do not create eager dependencies.
Literal guards and direct comparisons of `sys.platform`, `os.name`, and
`sys.version_info` select only the active branch, including imported aliases.
Other conditions are analyzed conservatively and may require a restart if their
alternative imports form a cycle. No guard expression is executed during planning.
A detected import cycle or invalid source reports an error before reloading modules.

Restart for changes to startup code, the custom agent's construction, or dependencies
loaded dynamically rather than declared by module-scope imports. `/reload` does not
rerun the CLI or recursively reload third-party packages. Import-time side effects
still cannot be undone. Use `/plugins reload NAME` when you only want to reload one
plugin.

## Saved sessions and `/resume`

CLAI saves accepted prompts before the first model request and saves the retained
history after successful, failed, and cancelled turns. `/compact` commits its
replacement immediately, even if you exit before another prompt. `/new` switches
to a fresh session ID; it does not delete the previous session.

```bash
clai2 --resume                 # browse saved sessions
clai2 --resume SESSION-ID      # restore one session
```

Inside CLAI, `/resume` opens the same browser and `/resume SESSION-ID` restores a
session directly. Opening or restoring a session does not call the coding model
or execute pending tools. Background naming may make a separate, tool-free model
request. Your current model, working directory, credentials, and approved plugins
remain in effect. The saved model name is shown for reference.

The browser follows Code Puppy's project/session design:

- Projects on the left, with session counts. The current directory is preselected.
  The selected project stays highlighted while browsing its sessions. **SELECT
  PROJECT** or **SELECT SESSION** labels the focused pane, with matching key hints.
- Two-line session cards on the right: time, title, subtitle, tags, message and
  token counts. Recent sorting groups cards by local calendar date.
- Enter opens a project or resumes a session. Right opens a scrollable transcript,
  with newer messages first. Left returns to projects.
- `/` searches across projects, including saved user/assistant text. `s` cycles
  recent, message-count, and token-count sorting. `m` loads another 200 summaries.
- `r` sets a manual title, which the namer will not overwrite. `d` asks for
  confirmation before deletion. The active session cannot be deleted.
- Esc goes back; Ctrl-C closes. Narrow screens show one focused pane at a time.
- Selecting a session from another directory asks for confirmation. It does not
  change directories or move the saved conversation out of its original project
  group. Direct cross-directory resume asks you to use the browser.

The browser counts loaded summaries, not a separate unbounded catalog. Search
runs against the full catalog before pagination. It does not index tool output,
reasoning, or content removed by compaction.

The resume transcript preview displays at most 24,000 characters of the newest-first
text, with a truncation notice for longer histories. Search is Unicode
case-insensitive and includes text instructions in multimodal prompts.

### Background names

A saved session immediately gets a fallback title from its first prompt. A
single background worker can replace it with a short title, subtitle, and up to
four topic tags. The browser refreshes names while idle without moving selection.

The worker uses the previous summary plus up to 2,400 characters of recent
user/assistant text. It refreshes generated names after 16 content revisions;
revisions, unlike message offsets, survive compaction. This is a bounded current
summary, not a lossless incremental transcript archive. Opening the browser
backfills up to ten eligible sessions. Queue length, request count, output size,
and a 60-second deadline bound the work. Exiting cancels and joins the worker.

```text
/set sessions.naming false
/set sessions.naming_model openai:gpt-5-mini
/set sessions.naming_model null
```

Naming is enabled by default and uses the current model unless overridden.
It sends conversation excerpts to that model's provider and incurs additional
usage. It has no tools and does not inherit coding plugins. Missing credentials,
timeouts, invalid output, or stale results leave the existing name usable and do
not interrupt foreground work. `/usage` and the browser preview show persisted
naming token counts separately; `/cost` remains retained foreground-history cost.

### Storage and recovery limits

Conversations, metadata, and step records live in `sessions.db` beside the settings
database. `--database` therefore also selects the directory for saved sessions.
New conversation databases use owner-only file permissions where supported. The
contents are **not encrypted**: prompts, replies, tool results, and media may
contain secrets. Do not share the database between machines. An unfinished run
whose recorded process is still alive is treated as busy; revision checks reject
stale writers instead of overwriting another process's work.

The built-in `persistence` plugin records additional Harness checkpoints before
model requests, after model responses, and at settled tool-cycle boundaries.
`/plugins disable persistence` disables that extra step capture, not conversation
saving. Without it, a hard kill recovers the accepted prompt and preceding saved
history, not the in-flight turn's progress.

An interrupted session is marked `!`. If a process died mid-run, resume loads its
newest available step checkpoint and warns you to inspect external effects. A
completed tool in a partially completed parallel batch may still have no saved
result. An older settled checkpoint does not undo later file writes or commands.
There is no automatic tool replay, side-effect deduplication, workspace rollback,
or restoration of arbitrary plugin state.

Deletion removes the conversation and associated run records in the same SQLite
transaction. Shared content-addressed media is retained; deletion is not secure
erasure. Snapshot retention keeps eight recent checkpoints per run, plus the
latest settled recovery point when needed. There is no whole-session TTL or media
garbage collection.

## Usage and cost

`/usage` prints a table of the current conversation: one row per turn with the
request count, input tokens, cache read and write tokens when a turn used them,
output tokens, and cost, followed by a totals row. `/cost` prints the retained
history's total on one line. Both are derived from the retained messages, so
`/new` resets them, and a cancelled turn's partial responses are counted.
Compaction drops older responses from these totals; summary requests are not
included. These are not lifetime spending totals or a billing ledger.

Prices come from core's genai-prices data for the response's model and provider.
When there is no price data (a local model, `openrouter` and `vllm` models it
does not list, or an unreleased model), the cost cell reads `unknown` rather
than zero, the line under the table names the model, and only the cost total
excludes those responses. Their requests and tokens remain in the usage totals. Cost is shown to four decimal places; a nonzero amount below that
reads `<$0.0001`. There is no spending cap here; use the agent's `UsageLimits`
for that.

## Compacting the conversation

The built-in `compaction` plugin uses harness's `FallbackCompaction` with
`SummarizingCompaction` first and `SlidingWindowCompaction` as the fallback.
It protects the most recent 50,000 tokens. `ModelAPIError`,
`FallbackExceptionGroup`, and `UsageLimitExceeded` during summarisation fall
back to truncation; other exceptions propagate. The summary request is billed
to the current model unless `summarization_model` selects another.

The chain runs automatically before requests above `threshold` (85% of the context
window by default). `/compact` runs the same chain between turns regardless of that
threshold. Add words to say what the summary must keep: `/compact the auth refactor, not the CSS`. You get one line
with the message counts before and after and an estimate of the tokens saved.
An empty conversation, or one that fits inside the protected tail, says so and
sends nothing.

The window comes from genai-prices, the same catalog the `/add_model` menu shows
context sizes from. A model it does not list (`test`, a local endpoint) is
assumed to have 200,000 tokens, the harness default. To change any of this,
redeclare the plugin with your own settings; `/plugins disable compaction`
turns it off, `/compact` included:

```text
/plugins add compaction pydantic_clai2.compaction '{"threshold": 0.7, "protected_tokens": 20000, "context_window": 200000}'
```

| Key | Default | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `strategy` | `"summarization"` | `"truncation"` skips the summary and only drops older messages |
| `threshold` | `0.85` | fraction of the window above which the fallback chain runs |
| `protected_tokens` | `50000` | tokens of the most recent messages never compacted |
| `context_window` | unset | overrides the catalog when it is wrong or silent for your model |
| `summarization_model` | unset | a cheaper model to write the summary; unset uses the one in use |

The context figure turns yellow when a request still exceeds `threshold` after
compaction, for example because the protected tail is too large. For windows smaller
than 50,000 tokens, redeclare the plugin with a smaller `protected_tokens` value;
`/compact` does not override that protection. Run `/compact` to retry the chain,
or `/new` to clear the history. The figure and colour
refresh with the next request; `/compact` alone does not change them.

## Ask CLAI to customize itself

Ask, for example, "Create a plugin with a custom menu" or "Use my model provider".
The default agent has a `read_clai_customization_guide` tool and a short instruction
to read it before advising on CLAI customization. The guide is bundled with the
installed package and loaded only when the tool is called, not included in every
prompt. No network access or source checkout is needed to read it.
This tool needs no arguments and ignores extra arguments supplied by a model.
Other tools keep their existing validation.

It covers plugin installation and reload, hooks, tools, settings, commands,
rendering, custom TUI menus, and model/provider launchers. It distinguishes plugin
APIs from UI changes that currently need a CLAI source change. This is guidance,
not an automatic installer or a permission boundary: plugins execute trusted Python
as your user. Review generated plugins before enabling them.

Custom agents are unchanged. To offer the same guide, add

## Bring an agent

```python
import asyncio
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_clai2 import chat

agent = Agent('test')  # No capabilities required.
asyncio.run(chat(agent, deps=None))
```

`Session(agent, deps=..., plugins=..., on_stream_event=...)` is the noninteractive
API. Call `await session.prompt(text)` for each turn, or
`await session.prompt(text, images=[BinaryContent(data=png_bytes, media_type="image/png")])`
for image input (`BinaryContent` comes from `pydantic_ai.messages`). Native `agent.run` drives the
loop through tools to completion. Successful turns retain `result.all_messages()`;
cancelled turns retain the prompt and messages captured by Pydantic AI, including
interrupted responses and tool results. Failed turns leave the previous history
intact. External tool side effects may already have occurred. History is in memory
only. Structured outputs are supported and displayed after completion.

CLAI is painted in the Pydantic brand palette: Lithium magenta for headings,
the banner, and the thing to look at; Calcium for list markers and errors; Aqua
for links and added diff lines; Pydantic AI cyan for guidance; purple with a
magenta-to-white shimmer for the active status line and plain purple while idle;
brand grey for tool previews and hints. On terminals without 24-bit
colour the nearest of the 16 standard colours is used. Every colour lives in
`theme.py`. This is local to CLAI; it does not change your terminal's colours
or Termflow defaults elsewhere. Code block syntax highlighting retains Termflow's
Monokai default.

Streaming uses the defaults from [Code Puppy's smoothing adapters](https://github.com/mpfaffenberger/code_puppy/blob/a862bf478b63822c9d97093f81e4f827e1c53d6e/code_puppy/agents/smooth_stream.py):

- Markdown uses Termflow `SmoothWriter`: 12 ms ticks, 0.5-second catch-up,
  minimum one visible character per tick. Markdown is parsed line-by-line.
- Thinking deltas feed `StreamSmoother` immediately: 20 ms ticks, 0.4-second
  catch-up, minimum two characters per tick. They display as dim literal text,
  without waiting for newlines or interpreting Markdown.
- Each partial write requests an editor redraw instead of waiting for the
  100 ms spinner/footer refresh. Partial-text redraw requests use a 12 ms
  minimum interval so bursts can coalesce without reducing streaming to ten
  updates per second.
- Smoothing applies only to interactive terminal output. Redirected output is
  written directly. Parts drain before the next heading, tool status, or prompt.

`/set display.smooth_seconds 0.5` restores the Code Puppy response catch-up
window if you previously saved a slower preference. This response-only setting
accepts 0.1 to 5 seconds; thinking retains its separate 0.4-second window.
Empty thinking parts show no heading. The CLI disables core's first-run
observability banner.
Cancellation discards queued output. Incomplete Markdown lines are still buffered
until a newline or part end; smoothing does not remove that parsing delay.
Thinking signatures without text cannot be shown. A supplied agent's existing
stream handler is preserved. Custom renderer integrations must await `finish()`
and use `await abort()` on cancellation.

Response and thinking parts end with a blank separator line; responses have no
repeated CLAI heading. Intermediate text is flushed when a tool-call part begins,
before the tool's arguments finish streaming. Incomplete lines within a text part
still wait for a newline or part boundary, as in Code Puppy's Markdown path.

Tool calls print once with a filled-circle marker and the tool name, followed by one blank line. Long names
are truncated to one terminal row. Completion activity remains in the footer
rather than adding a separate `Finished:` line to the transcript.

## Grep previews

Grep calls display the expression and path. Results show the first 20 logical
lines by default; `/set display.grep_lines 10` changes the next turn's preview
(0 to 1000). `Truncated N result lines` counts returned lines hidden by the UI,
including context lines. If the tool itself capped the search, a separate notice
states that the additional result count is unknown. No matches is shown explicitly.
The model still receives the original tool result.

Shell output is rendered one completed line at a time. Carriage-return progress
updates replace the buffered line rather than printing control-code text; the last
update appears at newline or tool completion. CRLF works across chunk boundaries.
Long display lines are ellipsized to terminal width. Multiline commands show their
first line and the number of additional command lines rather than dumping scripts.
Full output remains in the log; display formatting does not alter model results.

## Shell preview limit

Shell output defaults to the first 20 logical lines per command. Change it with
`/set display.shell_lines 50` (0 to 1000; zero hides output). The setting applies
to the next prompt. After the command returns, `Truncated N lines` reports omitted
lines from the log snapshot at that time, including an unterminated final line.
The capability's 16 KB event preview cap can shorten the preview further. Full
output remains in the displayed log path. Background commands can keep writing
after the snapshot; those future lines are not included in its count.

Read headers show the path, zero-based offset, and effective line limit (Coder
default and maximum: 2000). Listing headers show the directory, recursive mode,
result limit (default 200), and optional glob. Coder listings recurse using
ripgrep and honor ignore rules. These displayed defaults describe Coder tools.

File-write/edit headers include the path on the same line as the tool name.
Shell headers include the command on that line. Arguments use cyan, with no
repeated completion heading before the diff or output.

## Tool details

Native capability events drive specialized output: `FileEditedEvent` renders its
bounded unified diff using Termflow `DiffRenderer`, the same renderer Code Puppy
uses. Addition backgrounds are muted teal (`#203c3b`), deletion backgrounds are
muted burgundy (`#432d3b`), and brighter markers distinguish the changes. Code
syntax colors are unchanged. Successful file writes also show the proposed diff from their matching
`FileChangeRequestEvent`: new files show additions, overwrites show before/after
changes. Without a matching request event, only the written path is shown. Failed
or cancelled writes do not display a success diff. Large diffs retain the
filesystem's truncation notice. Coder shell events show the command, attached
combined output, exit status (or background state), and durable log paths. Output
is capped by the capability and truncation is marked. The standalone `Shell`
capability does not yet emit these Coder-specific shell events.

Terminal control characters in model text and diffs are escaped before rendering.
Shell output permits ANSI SGR color/style sequences, decoded into Rich text rather
than passed directly to the terminal. Styles persist across chunks and lines per
command; cursor movement, clipboard commands, and other controls remain escaped.
Plain shell output stays dim. ANSI generated by Termflow itself is retained.

## Status line

The terminal footer shows the selected model, activity, latest reported
context tokens, and streamed output estimate, including text, thinking, and
string tool-argument deltas. The estimate is characters divided by four, not a
provider tokenizer count. On completion it is replaced by reported run output
usage. Context is the most recent response's reported input plus output tokens,
not cumulative conversation billing or a context-window percentage; `?` means
unavailable. As each request goes out, the `compaction` plugin replaces it with
that request's estimated size and paints it yellow while the history is
[over its threshold](#compacting-the-conversation); the response's reported
usage takes over when it lands. The retained-history cost (`$0.0123`) follows the
output count, updated after each turn and hidden until a response has price data.
After `/compact`, the footer keeps the previous figure until the next turn;
`/cost` and `/usage` read the retained history immediately.

Prompt-toolkit owns the editor, cursor, and footer during both input and agent
turns. Complete output lines scroll above the editor; the incomplete streaming
line is displayed separately above the input frame until it is complete. Status
refreshes ten times per second. Terminals shorter than six rows or narrower than
four columns omit the input border. Redirected output has no live editor or footer.
No model requests or telemetry are added for status reporting.

A plugin can append its own fragment to the row with `host.status_segment`, such
as the working directory or a branch name; fragments are muted and dropped when
the plugin unloads. See [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md) for the registration and its
cost rules.

## Plugins

Everything beyond the prompt loop is a plugin, including the default coding
tools. Any Pydantic AI capability is a plugin as it is; give the agent web
search from Pydantic AI Harness without writing code. Install the `exa` extra
and set `EXA_API_KEY` first:

```sh
pip install 'pydantic-ai-harness[exa]'
export EXA_API_KEY=...
```

```text
/plugins add exa pydantic_ai_harness.exa:ExaSearch '{"num_results": 8}'
```

For anything beyond one capability, a plugin is a Python file with an
`activate(host)` function. A single plugin can do as much as it likes; this one
both adds a capability and reacts to a lifecycle hook, to show two shapes at
once:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.exa import ExaSearch

from pydantic_clai2.plugins import PluginHost, TurnEnd


def activate(host: PluginHost) -> None:
    host.add(ExaSearch(num_results=8))

    @host.on('turn_end')
    async def ping(event: TurnEnd) -> None:
        host.console.bell()
```

Drop the file in `~/.config/pydantic-clai2/plugins/`, or register anything
importable with `/plugins add NAME module[:attr] [JSON]`. It is live for the
next prompt; no restart. `/plugins` alone opens a full-screen menu to enable, disable,
reload, and remove. Closing the menu returns to the prompt without printing the
plugin list. Use `/plugins list` to print it. Plugins are trusted code running as you.

[PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md) has the full list of hooks, events, and rules.

## Questions from the model

When the task is ambiguous, the model can call `ask_user_question` instead of
guessing. Each question opens a full-screen menu: options as rows, the question
and the highlighted option's description alongside, `question 2 of 3` in the
title when there are several. Enter picks one; on multi-select questions Space
toggles and Enter confirms (with nothing toggled, Enter picks the highlighted
option); Esc or Ctrl-C declines, which the model is told so it can make a
stated choice and carry on. Your picks are printed to the
transcript afterwards.

The menu is the built-in `ask_user` plugin around the harness's
[`AskUser`](../docs/ask-user.md) capability. The capability only knows an
`Answerer`; the terminal menu is one, and [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md#ask_user-questions-answered-from-the-terminal)
shows how to put a different one, a web form for instance, in its place.
`/plugins disable ask_user` removes the tool.

## Telemetry and references

CLAI emits no additional telemetry. Pydantic AI's own instrumentation covers model
requests, tools, and capability hooks when configured on the supplied agent.

## vllm connection

Open `/add_model`, choose `vllm`, then enter a trusted HTTP(S) server root or `/v1` URL, and optionally a token. CLAI queries `/v1/models` and opens a searchable model picker. HTTP sends tokens unencrypted; use HTTPS outside trusted local networks. The connection is saved like Codex's, see [Codex authentication](#codex-authentication).

## openrouter connection

Open `/add_model`, choose `openrouter`, then choose **Sign in with browser** or **Enter API key**. Browser sign-in opens OpenRouter's [PKCE authorization flow](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/oauth-pkce) and receives an authorization code on a temporary loopback listener. CLAI exchanges the code for a user-controlled API key over HTTPS. If the browser cannot reach CLAI (for example over SSH), paste the final callback URL or authorization code into the terminal. If no browser opens, open the printed authorization URL manually. Login times out after five minutes; Ctrl-C cancels it. You can revoke the generated key on OpenRouter.

Manual entry still accepts a key from https://openrouter.ai/keys in a masked prompt. After either method, select a model from the live catalog. CLAI validates the key with `/api/v1/key` before fetching `/api/v1/models`. Cancelling before model selection leaves the saved connection unchanged.

The connection is saved in the configured Python keyring backend after selection, or in a per-user `0600` file when no keyring backend exists, as described in [Codex authentication](#codex-authentication). Backend security depends on your keyring configuration. Tokens are not stored in SQLite or command history. The selected model persists across restarts. Select the provider again to browse its live models or reconfigure the saved connection. Discovery is explicit and has a 20-second network timeout; redirects are not followed. Agent inference uses Pydantic AI core.


## Saved API keys

Open `/keys` to browse and manage saved API keys in a full-screen menu.
Use A to add, Enter to replace a value, R to rename, and D to delete with
confirmation. Values are masked and are not shown in previews. Changes save
immediately; Esc or Ctrl-C closes the menu. Errors appear inside the menu.

The compatibility command `/set api_key` prompts for a name and masked API key. Names are trimmed
and uppercased automatically, so `my_vllm_key` becomes `MY_VLLM_KEY`. Use letters,
numbers, and underscores, starting with a letter or underscore. Saving an existing
name asks before replacing it. Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D cancels without saving. Do not put
the secret on the command line.

When saved keys exist, vLLM's token prompt and OpenRouter's **Enter API key** flow
show a searchable list of names. Choose one, enter a different key privately, or
choose **No API key** for vLLM. Esc closes the picker without connecting. Browser
login flows are unchanged. Select keys only for endpoints you trust.

Named keys use the existing credential backend, separate from provider logins and
SQLite settings. If no OS keyring exists, CLAI warns that it saved them in the
per-user `0600` plaintext file `credentials-api-keys.json` in its config directory.
Key values never appear in the picker or confirmation. Names are labels, not
exported environment variables. Selecting a saved key stores a reference, not a copy. Discovery and each new
turn resolve its current value. Replacing a key updates connections that reference
it. Deleting it makes those connections fail until you restore the same name or
reconfigure them. Keys referenced by saved connections cannot be renamed. A cross-process lock
serializes key changes and connection saves so concurrent CLAI sessions do not
overwrite each other's key edits. The lock file contains no credentials.

Existing connections with inline credentials, manually entered connection keys,
and browser logins remain unchanged. To switch an existing connection to a
reference, reconfigure it through `/add_model` and select a saved key. Changes do not
alter an already running request or revoke credentials at the provider.
