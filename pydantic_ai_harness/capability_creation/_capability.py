    """Create Pydantic AI capabilities during one run for activation on the next.

    Exposes `author_capability(name, code)`, `list_authored_capabilities`, and
    `disable_authored_capability`. Authoring writes Python source to `directory`,
    imports it, and validates it (exactly one `AbstractCapability` subclass that
    constructs with no arguments and whose static getters run). Authored
    capabilities hold live code, so they are not spec-serializable and are
    persisted as source rather than as a spec.

    Activation boundary: a capability cannot be added to a live, already-executing
    run -- pydantic-ai resolves the capability set once at the start of each run.
    The authored capability becomes usable on the next `agent.run(...)`. The
    integration contract is one line on the orchestrator side: thread the store's
    active capabilities into the next run.

    ```python
    from pathlib import Path

    from pydantic_ai import Agent
    from pydantic_ai_harness.capability_creation import CapabilityCreation

    creation = CapabilityCreation(directory=Path('.authored'))
    agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[creation])

    # Loop: each iteration injects whatever the agent has authored so far.
    result = await agent.run('build a logging capability', capabilities=creation.store.load_active())
    ```

    This executes authored Python in-process -- the same trust boundary an agent
    that already runs shell commands and edits files operates under.
