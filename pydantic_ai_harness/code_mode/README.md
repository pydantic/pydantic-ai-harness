# Code Mode

Replace individual tool calls with a single sandboxed Python execution environment.

[Source](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/tree/main/pydantic_ai_harness/code_mode/)

## The problem

Standard tool calling often needs another model turn for each dependent batch of tool calls. An agent
that needs to fetch 10 items and then process their results can require many model turns, increasing
latency, cost, and context use.

## The solution

`CodeMode` wraps eligible tools into a single `run_code` tool. The model writes orchestration code
with loops, conditionals, variables, and `asyncio.gather` inside a sandboxed
[Monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty) runtime. Calls from that code are dispatched through
Pydantic AI to the host tools.

| Standard tool calling | Code mode |
|---|---|
| Dependent tool batches across model turns | Many dependent calls in one `run_code` |
| Parallel only when the model emits a batch | Parallelism expressed in Python |
| No local computation | Filter, transform, aggregate in code |
| Large conversation history | Compact -- fewer messages |

Durable execution integrations can record nested calls for deterministic replay.

## Usage

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[CodeMode()])

@agent.tool_plain
def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """Get current weather for a city."""
    return {'city': city, 'temp_f': 72, 'condition': 'sunny'}

result = agent.run_sync("What's the weather in Paris and Tokyo, in Celsius?")
print(result.output)
```

The model writes code like:

```python
import asyncio

paris, tokyo = await asyncio.gather(
    get_weather(city='Paris'),
    get_weather(city='Tokyo'),
)
paris_c = round((paris['temp_f'] - 32) * 5 / 9, 1)
tokyo_c = round((tokyo['temp_f'] - 32) * 5 / 9, 1)
{'paris': paris_c, 'tokyo': tokyo_c}
```

## In practice

The [harness Quick start](../../README.md#quick-start) wires `CodeMode` up against an MCP server and a web search and asks it to find the most-discussed Hacker News story across three feeds, pull the comment thread and the submitter's profile, and search the web for follow-up coverage. CodeMode collapses that into two `run_code` calls: the first fetches all three feeds in parallel via `asyncio.gather`, dedupes by id, filters by score, and ranks by comment count -- in plain Python; the second batches the three follow-up calls (`hn_get_thread`, `hn_get_user`, `duckduckgo_search`) together.

[![CodeMode's first run_code: parallel asyncio.gather over three HN feeds, then a dedupe and a score filter](../../docs/images/code-mode-trace.png)](https://logfire-us.pydantic.dev/public-trace/84bcf123-2106-49da-9f6f-5c26395339bb?spanId=7650806a0785b946)

**[See the full Logfire trace ->](https://logfire-us.pydantic.dev/public-trace/84bcf123-2106-49da-9f6f-5c26395339bb?spanId=7650806a0785b946)** Each `run_code` span fans out into the tool calls the model issued from inside the sandbox -- the easiest way to understand what code mode actually did. See the [Pydantic AI Logfire docs](https://ai.pydantic.dev/logfire/) for setup details.

## Installation

Code mode requires the Monty sandbox:

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[codemode]"
```

The `code-mode` extra is also supported as an alias.

## Selective tool sandboxing

By default, `CodeMode(tools='all')` sandboxes every eligible regular tool. Framework control tools,
undiscovered deferred tools, native fallbacks, and other code-execution tools remain native. You can
control which eligible tools go through the sandbox:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

# By name -- only these tools are available inside run_code
CodeMode(tools=['search', 'fetch'])

# By predicate
CodeMode(tools=lambda ctx, td: td.name != 'dangerous_tool')

# By metadata -- combine with SetToolMetadata or .with_metadata()
CodeMode(tools={'code_mode': True})
```

Tools that match the selector are wrapped inside `run_code`. Non-matching tools remain available as regular tool calls.

### Tool Search

When you mark tools or whole toolsets `defer_loading=True` ([Tool Search](https://ai.pydantic.dev/tools-advanced/#tool-search)), `CodeMode` keeps them out of `run_code` while they're undiscovered -- they pass straight through, so Tool Search drives them as usual (sent on the wire with `defer_loading` on providers with native tool search; otherwise dropped until discovered, with a `search_tools` tool alongside `run_code`). `CodeMode` uses `RunContext.is_tool_available` to follow that reveal state. Once the model discovers a tool -- or loads the deferred capability that owns it -- `CodeMode` folds it into `run_code` like any other tool from then on, so it's callable from generated code. (The tool keeps `defer_loading=True`, which records what its author asked for; what changes is its availability for the run.)

That fold-in grows `run_code`'s description, which invalidates the prompt-cache prefix once at the moment of discovery (turns with no discovery stay cache-warm). Two ways to avoid the bust:

- Pass `dynamic_catalog=True` to keep `run_code.description` static across discoveries -- the catalog of sandboxed-tool signatures moves into agent instructions (as a dynamic [`InstructionPart`](https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/messages/#pydantic_ai.messages.InstructionPart)) and newly-discovered tools are announced via [`ctx.enqueue`](https://ai.pydantic.dev/api/tools/#pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.enqueue) instead of by rebuilding the description:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

CodeMode(dynamic_catalog=True)
```

  This pays off when paired with Tool Search: the tool-definitions block stays byte-stable so the prefix cache survives discoveries, at the cost of a larger (but cache-friendly) system prompt. With a fixed toolset and no Tool Search, the default keeps the system prompt shorter and is the better choice.

- To instead keep a Tool Search corpus fully native -- never folded into `run_code`, but not callable from inside it -- exclude it with a `tools` selector; corpus members carry `with_native` set to the managing native tool:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

CodeMode(tools=lambda ctx, td: td.with_native is None)
```


### Metadata-based selection

Use metadata when the decision should travel with a tool or toolset, rather than
with one `CodeMode` instance. This is useful for shared toolsets: the toolset
author can tag the tools that are safe and useful to call from generated code,
and each agent can opt into that tag with `CodeMode(tools={...})`.

`CodeMode(tools={'code_mode': True})` uses the standard Pydantic AI
`ToolSelector` metadata form. A tool is sandboxed when its
`ToolDefinition.metadata` contains all of the selector's key-value pairs. Extra
metadata on the tool is fine, and nested dictionaries are matched by deep
inclusion.

The common pattern is to tag an entire toolset with `.with_metadata(...)`:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.toolsets import FunctionToolset
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode


def search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the web."""
    return f'results for {query}'


def fetch(url: str) -> str:
    """Fetch a URL."""
    return f'contents of {url}'


search_tools = FunctionToolset(tools=[search, fetch]).with_metadata(code_mode=True)

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    toolsets=[search_tools],
    capabilities=[CodeMode(tools={'code_mode': True})],
)
```

Here `search` and `fetch` are removed from the model-facing tool list and
become callable functions inside `run_code`. Tools without
`metadata['code_mode'] == True` stay visible as regular tool calls.

## Return values

The last expression in the code snippet is automatically captured as the return value -- the model does not need to `print()`. An assignment stores a value in the REPL but does not return it. A final expression that evaluates to `None` is also treated as no result. Without a non-`None` final expression or print output, `run_code` returns `{}`. Put the assigned name on the final line:

```python
result = await get_weather(city='Paris')
result
```

| Scenario | Return |
|---|---|
| Non-`None` final expression with no print output | Last expression value |
| Final assignment or `None` result with no print output | `{}` |
| Print output with no final expression or a `None` result | `{"output": "<printed text>"}` |
| Print output with a plain, non-`None` final expression | `{"output": "<printed text>", "result": <last expression>}` |
| Multimodal final expression with no print output | Returned natively for model processing |
| Print output with a multimodal final expression | List with printed text followed by native multimodal content |

Printed output is limited to 10 MiB. Exceeding the limit makes `run_code` return a model retry.

## REPL state

State persists between `run_code` calls within the same agent run -- variables, imports, and function definitions carry over. Pass `restart: true` in the tool call to reset state. If a worker crash or host-side execution failure invalidates the session, `run_code` returns a model retry that reports the reset; the next snippet must recreate any required state.

## Remote workers over WebSockets

Set `monty_sandbox_url` to run the Monty worker remotely instead of spawning local worker subprocesses:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    capabilities=[CodeMode(monty_sandbox_url='wss://sandbox.example.com/monty')],
)
```

The URL must use `wss://` (plaintext `ws://` is only accepted for loopback hosts, e.g. a
local relay or a TLS-terminating sidecar) and point to a server that bridges each WebSocket
connection to one Monty worker -- Monty's `monty-server` is built for this, or any relay that
forwards frames to a worker fits. The WebSocket side carries one binary Monty protocol frame per
message. A relay backed by `monty subprocess` adds the worker's four-byte little-endian length
prefix before writing each frame to stdin and removes it when reading frames from stdout.

Only sandbox execution moves to the remote worker. Tool dispatch, mounted directory access,
`os_access` calls, and print collection are still serviced by the host over the connection. The
REPL session remains checked out for the agent run, so state persists across `run_code` calls as it
does with local workers.

The WebSocket transport has a 10-second deadline for each remote protocol turn. The deadline
covers worker-side execution only: while the sandbox is suspended waiting for a host tool call, the
clock is not running, so slow tools are safe. Sandbox code that computes for longer than the
deadline between suspensions surfaces as a sandbox-crash retry and resets the session. `monty_sandbox_url` cannot be used
inside a Temporal workflow because that workflow-side path requires Monty's synchronous snapshot
API.

## Temporal durability

Install both integrations:

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[codemode,temporal]"
```

Construct the named agent and its stable-ID toolsets outside the workflow, then attach
`TemporalDurability` alongside `CodeMode`:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.durable_exec.temporal import TemporalDurability
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.6-sol',
    name='coding-agent',
    capabilities=[CodeMode(), TemporalDurability()],
)
```

Follow the [Pydantic AI Temporal guide](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/capabilities/durable_execution/temporal/)
to call the plain agent from a workflow and register its activities with `PydanticAIPlugin` and
either `__pydantic_ai_agents__` or `AgentPlugin`.

`PydanticAIPlugin` passes `pydantic_monty` through Temporal's workflow sandbox. This makes Monty
runnable there, but `run_code` still executes in workflow code and is re-executed during replay.
CodeMode deliberately uses Monty's synchronous snapshot API in this path because Temporal's
deterministic workflow event loop cannot be woken by Monty's async worker I/O thread. For this
reason, `monty_sandbox_url` is not available inside a Temporal workflow.
Model requests and, by default, nested tool calls cross Temporal activity boundaries;
`asyncio.gather` can schedule nested tool activities concurrently. The REPL is process-local state
for one agent run, not durable storage. Replay reconstructs it by running the recorded snippets
again against recorded activity results.

Keep workflow-side code deterministic. `mount` reads and writes, `os_access` callbacks, and
host-clock calls happen again during replay; changing their results can change which activities the
workflow schedules and cause a `NondeterminismError`. Put external reads, writes, clock access, and
other side effects in wrapped tools so Temporal records them as activities. Replay may not flag
changed arguments when the same activity remains at the same history position, so replay validation
is not a substitute for this boundary. Temporal activity timeouts apply to nested tools, not pure
computation inside `run_code`, so keep sandbox loops bounded.

## Observability

Nested tool calls inside `run_code` produce their own spans when instrumented with [Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) or any OpenTelemetry backend. The `run_code` tool return includes metadata with all nested calls:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.messages import ToolReturnPart
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[CodeMode()])


@agent.tool_plain
def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """Get current weather for a city."""
    return {'city': city, 'temp_f': 72}


result = agent.run_sync("What's the weather in Paris?")

for msg in result.all_messages():
    for part in msg.parts:
        if isinstance(part, ToolReturnPart) and part.tool_name == 'run_code':
            metadata = part.metadata or {}
            tool_calls = metadata['tool_calls']      # dict[str, ToolCallPart]
            tool_returns = metadata['tool_returns']  # dict[str, ToolReturnPart]
```

## Filesystem and OS access

Sandboxed code starts with no access to the host's files, environment, or clock. Two parameters add
controlled filesystem, environment, or clock behavior.

**`mount` -- share host directories.** Reach for this when the agent works with real files: analyzing
a dataset you've dropped in a folder and writing a report back, editing a checkout, or processing a
batch of documents. Sandboxed `pathlib` code reads and writes under the mounted path. (For
environment variables or the clock, use `os_access` instead.)

```python
from pydantic_monty import MountDir

from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

# The agent can read /work/data.csv and write /work/summary.md back to the host:
CodeMode(mount=MountDir(virtual_path='/work', host_path='/tmp/agent-workspace', mode='read-write'))
```

**`os_access` -- answer the sandbox's OS calls yourself.** Reach for this when the agent needs
environment variables, the current date and time, or filesystem behavior you control. Hand it a
ready-made OS implementation, or a callback that decides each call -- so you can inject just the
secrets it needs, pin "now" for reproducible runs, or route file access to your own store.

```python
from pydantic_monty import NOT_HANDLED, OSAccess

from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

# Give the agent a fixed set of environment values:
CodeMode(os_access=OSAccess(environ={'API_BASE': 'https://api.example.com'}))


# ...or intercept each call to decide what the agent may see:
allowed_env = {'API_KEY': 'sk-...'}


def my_os(fn, args, kwargs):
    if fn == 'os.getenv':
        # Answer the call: allow-listed keys resolve, every other key reads back
        # as None -- absent, exactly like a real unset variable.
        return allowed_env.get(args[0])
    # Refuse everything else: NOT_HANDLED makes the call fail in the sandbox.
    return NOT_HANDLED


CodeMode(os_access=my_os)
```

Your callback's return value decides the call's fate, and the two outcomes are easy to confuse:

- **Return any value** -- including `None`, `''`, or `0` -- and that becomes the result the sandbox
  sees. `os.getenv` returning `None` looks exactly like a normal unset variable, so the agent's code
  keeps running. This is how you *hide* something: answer with an empty value.
- **Return `NOT_HANDLED`** and the call is treated as unsupported: it raises inside the sandbox and
  the model gets a retry. This *refuses* a capability outright -- use it to block, not to say "no
  value". Returning `NOT_HANDLED` for a key the agent reasonably expects will burn retries.

`mount` exposes the selected host directories. The built-in `OSAccess` uses an isolated in-memory
filesystem and environment but the host clock by default; a custom handler or `CallbackFile` can
expose other host resources. Access is fixed when the capability is built, so construct `CodeMode`
per request to scope it.

A `MountDir` defaults to copy-on-write `mode='overlay'`: the sandbox reads host files and sees writes
made during the current `run_code` call, but Monty discards those writes before the next call and they
do **not** reach the host. Pass `mode='read-write'` when later calls need to read the writes, or
`mode='read-only'` to forbid writes.

> Monty-specific: these parameters use Monty's `AbstractOS`/`MountDir` types.

## Sandbox restrictions

Code runs inside [Monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty), a sandboxed Python subset. Key restrictions:

- No third-party imports (allowed stdlib: `sys`, `typing`, `asyncio`, `math`, `json`, `re`,
  `unicodedata`, `datetime`, `os`, `pathlib`)
- `asyncio.gather(...)` accepts positional awaitables but no keyword arguments; other task creation
  and wait APIs are unavailable
- No wall-clock or timing primitives by default (`asyncio.sleep`, `datetime.datetime.now()`, `datetime.date.today()`, `time`) -- `datetime.datetime.now()`/`datetime.date.today()` become available when an `os_access` handler implements them (the built-in `OSAccess` does); `asyncio.sleep`/`time` never do
- No `import *`
- Filesystem I/O needs an `os_access` handler or a `mount`; `os.getenv`/`os.environ` need an `os_access` handler
- Tools requiring approval or with deferred (`CallDeferred`) execution are sandboxed like any other tool; without a `HandleDeferredToolCalls` (or equivalent) capability on the agent to resolve them inline, calling one from `run_code` raises an error that surfaces to the model as a retry

## API

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

CodeMode(
    tools='all',             # 'all', list[str], callable, or metadata dict
    max_retries=3,           # retries on sandbox execution errors
    id=None,                 # required when defer_loading=True
    description=None,        # one-line catalog entry shown while deferred
    defer_loading=False,
    os_access=None,          # OS behavior; custom handlers may expose host resources
    mount=None,              # host directories to share with the sandbox
    monty_sandbox_url=None,  # ws:// or wss:// remote Monty worker relay
    dynamic_catalog=False,
)
```

## Agent spec (YAML/JSON)

CodeMode works with Pydantic AI's [agent spec](https://ai.pydantic.dev/agent-spec/) feature for defining agents in YAML:

```yaml
# agent.yaml
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6
capabilities:
  - CodeMode: {}
```

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

agent = Agent.from_file('agent.yaml', custom_capability_types=[CodeMode])
result = agent.run_sync('...')
print(result.output)
```

Pass `custom_capability_types` so the spec loader knows how to instantiate `CodeMode`. You can also pass arguments in the YAML:

```yaml
capabilities:
  - CodeMode:
      tools: ['search', 'fetch']
      max_retries: 5
```
