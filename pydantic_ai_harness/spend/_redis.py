"""Applies one response to a window and returns the four totals.

Redis runs a script to completion without interleaving another command, so the
four increments and the expiry either all land or none do. Issued separately --
even pipelined -- a failure between them leaves a window counting some of a
response and not the rest, which reads as a smaller number than was really spent
and so releases the brake later than it should.

The ceiling is checked here, against the running total, and before anything is
written. Checking the increment alone in Python would not hold: increments that
each pass can still carry the counter past the range where a Lua number is an
exact integer, and past that the totals this returns are rounded.
