"""Durable execution for Pydantic AI agents on the Restate engine.

Restate (`restate-sdk`) is a durable-execution engine. This module journals an agent's I/O --
model requests, MCP calls, function tool calls, and dynamic-toolset resolution -- into Restate
run steps (`ctx.run_typed(...)`), so a handler that crashes or is retried mid-run replays from
the journal instead of repeating the work.

Restate's durable primitive is async and its journal is positional: `ctx.run_typed(name, fn, ...)`
records `fn`'s result by encounter order, and on replay serves the recorded bytes without
re-running `fn`. The `name` is a label, not the journal identity. An agent run is async, so it
drives the primitive directly with no thread bridge. Outside a Restate context the capability is
transparent and the run is an ordinary, non-durable agent run.

    """Capability that makes an agent durable by journaling its I/O into Restate run steps.

    Attach it via `capabilities=[RestateDurability()]` and call `agent.run()` inside a Restate
    service handler: every model request, MCP call, function tool call, and dynamic-toolset
    resolution is wrapped in `ctx.run_typed(...)`, so a handler that crashes or is retried mid-run
    replays from the journal instead of repeating the work. A completed step is served from its
    journal entry on replay instead of being recomputed, so tokens are not re-spent on work that
    already finished. A step is journaled after it runs, so a crash between a tool's side effect
    and its journal entry re-runs the tool on recovery: keep tool side effects idempotent. Outside
    a Restate context the capability is transparent and the run is a normal, non-durable agent run.

    The capability discovers the agent's model, name, and toolsets automatically when it is bound
    to the agent. Step results are written to the Restate journal as JSON bytes, so a journaled
    tool's return value must be JSON-serializable. Serialization failures are terminal so Restate
    does not retry them as transient invocation failures. Control-flow signals (`ModelRetry`,
    `ApprovalRequired`, `CallDeferred`, `ToolFailed`) cross the journal as values rather than
    exceptions, with their metadata preserved, so approval and deferred-tool flows work inside a
    durable run.

    Example:
        ```python {test="skip"}
        import restate
        from pydantic_ai import Agent
        from pydantic_ai_harness.restate import RestateDurability

        agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5', name='analyst', capabilities=[RestateDurability()])
