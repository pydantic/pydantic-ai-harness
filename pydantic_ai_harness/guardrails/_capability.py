"""Input and output guardrail capabilities.

`InputGuard` intercepts the first model request and lets a user-supplied
callable decide what to do with the user prompt. `OutputGuard` runs as the
model output is processed and decides what to do with the agent output.

A guard returns a bare `bool` (`True` = allow) or a
[`GuardResult`][pydantic_ai_harness.guardrails.GuardResult] — one of four
outcomes:

- `allow` — let the value through unchanged.
- `block` — refuse: `InputGuard` short-circuits the model call with a refusal
  message via [`SkipModelRequest`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.SkipModelRequest];
  `OutputGuard` raises [`OutputBlocked`][pydantic_ai_harness.guardrails.OutputBlocked].
- `replace` — substitute a sanitized value (redaction) and continue.
- `retry` — send the output back to the model to try again (`OutputGuard` only).

A guard that raises propagates the exception so the caller sees a hard
failure. Guards may be sync or async and may optionally take a
[`RunContext`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext] as their first argument.

`replace` and `block` are recorded as spans on the active OpenTelemetry
tracer, so a redaction or refusal is visible in Logfire traces. Content
attributes (the original/replacement values and the refusal message) are
attached only when `RunContext.trace_include_content` is set.

    only after the model has responded, those tokens were still spent. Prefer
    sequential for fast local guards. `replace` (redaction) is incompatible
    with `parallel=True`, since the model call has already started with the
    original prompt.

    Scope: the guard runs exactly once per run — on the first model request —
    and evaluates the original user prompt. Subsequent model requests in the

    has not changed.

    The `guard` callable receives the output — no automatic stringification, so
    a typed output arrives as the Pydantic model instance — and returns one of
    the four outcomes (see the module docstring): `allow` exposes the output,
    `block` raises [`OutputBlocked`][pydantic_ai_harness.guardrails.OutputBlocked],
    `replace` substitutes a sanitized output (redaction), and `retry` sends the
    output back to the model to try again.

    ```python
    from pydantic_ai import Agent

        return GuardResult.allow()


    agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.4', capabilities=[OutputGuard(guard=no_pii)])
    ```

    The guard runs as the output is processed, so `retry` reuses pydantic-ai's
    normal retry machinery and counts against the run's output-retry budget.
    Like `InputGuard`, the guard may take a
    [`RunContext`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext] as a first parameter; it is
    detected from the signature.

    Ordering: declares `position='outermost'` so the guard sees the final
    output after every inner capability has processed it, and `wrapped_by=
    [Instrumentation]` so an enclosing `Instrumentation` span always captures
    the guard's block/redact spans regardless of user list order.

    Streaming caveats. `retry` is supported with
    [`run()`][pydantic_ai.Agent.run] / `run_sync()` only — pydantic-ai does not
    support output retries during [`run_stream()`][pydantic_ai.Agent.run_stream],
    where a `retry` verdict surfaces as
    [`UnexpectedModelBehavior`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.UnexpectedModelBehavior].
    The guard inspects only the final output, not partial chunks, so during a
    streamed run the caller may already have received partial output before a
    `block` or `replace` verdict is reached — use `run()` when the output must
    be screened before any of it is exposed.
