    """Back an agent's instructions with a Logfire-managed prompt.

    > **Legacy.** `ManagedPrompt` predates
    [`AgentControl`][pydantic_ai_harness.logfire.AgentControl]; a prompt-only `AgentControl` (an
    `AgentConfig` with just `instructions`) now covers the same use case and is the recommended
    path. `ManagedPrompt` keeps working for existing setups.

    **Prompt-cache trade-off:** the resolved value lands in the system instructions block, so any
    Logfire-side change to the prompt (new version rollout, label flip, A/B targeting) invalidates
    the provider's prompt cache for the affected runs. Pin a `label` (e.g. `'production'`) for the
    cache-stable path; treat percentage rollouts and per-user targeting as opt-in cache cost. See
    the README's "Prompt-cache trade-off" section for the full picture.

    Pass the managed prompt name and a default value and the capability declares the backing
    [managed variable](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/reference/advanced/managed-variables/)
    for you -- a name of `support_agent` resolves the variable `prompt__support_agent`, matching
    the naming Logfire's [Prompt management](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/reference/advanced/prompt-management/)
    uses. You can iterate on the prompt from the Logfire UI -- versioned, labelled, and rolled
    out -- without redeploying, while the code default keeps the agent working when no remote
    value is available.

    ```python
    import logfire
    from pydantic_ai import Agent

    from pydantic_ai_harness.logfire import ManagedPrompt

    logfire.configure()

    agent = Agent(
        'openai:gpt-5',
        capabilities=[
            ManagedPrompt(
                'support_agent',
                default='You are a helpful customer support agent. Be friendly and concise.',
                label='production',
            )
        ],
    )
    result = agent.run_sync('My order never arrived.')
    ```

    The prompt value is resolved **once per run**, inside the run's
    [`wrap_run`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.AbstractCapability.wrap_run] hook, using the
    [`ResolvedVariable`][logfire.variables.ResolvedVariable] as a context manager that stays open for the
    whole run -- so the selected label and version are attached as baggage to every child span
    of the agent run.

    Declaring the same name more than once is fine -- each `ManagedPrompt` constructs its own
    backing variable, so sharing a prompt across several agents just works. Pass an existing
    [`logfire.variables.Variable`][logfire.variables.Variable] as `name` instead of a prompt name
    when you want to use a variable you defined yourself (for example a `template_var`, or one
    registered for [`variables_push`][logfire.Logfire.variables_push]).
