"""Back an agent's Agent Control configuration with one Logfire variable.

The contract itself -- what an `AgentConfig` holds, how leniently it validates, and what a published
value does to a request -- lives in [`logfire.agent_control`][], shared by every framework adapter and
by the Logfire UI. This module is the Pydantic AI half of it: the capability wiring, the toolset that
carries managed definitions to the model, the bridge between the contract's string block ids and
[`InstructionPart.id`][pydantic_ai.messages.InstructionPart.id], and the hint span an agent
describes itself to Logfire on.

Nothing here writes to a Logfire variable. Every agent says what its code says on a span carrying its
code baseline, and creating a config from that -- or refreshing a stored baseline that no longer
matches -- is a Logfire-side flow. So a deployment needs no write scope, and the code baseline can
never race an edit saved in the UI.

published patch be handed to Pydantic AI as one -- so they are read off `AgentConfigSettings` rather
than restated here: a key the contract gains is one this adapter can already lower, and listing them
by hand would report it as a key Pydantic AI has no equivalent for until someone updated the list.

`precedence='exact'` because managed settings are contributed per request and merged under the keys
the caller passed to `run(model_settings=...)`, so the contract's order -- code, then published, then
the run -- holds key by key rather than being inferred from a diff against defaults.
`resolution_unit='run'` because the variable is resolved once per run, so a version published
mid-run reaches the next run, which is what lets every span of a run agree on the version that
produced it. Both happen to be the defaults, and are declared anyway: this value is what the editor
reads instead of guessing, and a field nobody wrote is indistinguishable from one nobody considered.

`destinations` is left empty, which says one unnamed sink. Pydantic AI assembles its prompt from many
blocks, but they are one prompt: an added block names no destination because there is only the one.

    """Manage an agent's config through one `agent__<name>` Logfire variable.

    The variable holds an [`AgentConfig`][logfire.agent_control.AgentConfig], the contract every
    Agent Control SDK shares. Each present section -- `instructions`, `model`, `settings`, or
    `tool_definitions` -- is managed from Logfire, while an absent section keeps the code-defined
    behavior. Removing a section in Logfire deliberately reverts that section to code.

    Instructions are the one section that **composes with** the agent instead of patching it, so it
    works in two ways, and which one an entry uses is the difference between a prompt that reads well
    and one sent to the model twice.

    An entry with **no `id` adds** a block. Adding is also the one way the same text can reach the
    model twice: seeding a config from an agent's observed prompt while that text stays in
    `Agent(instructions=...)` sends every block of it twice over.

    An entry **with an `id` swaps out** the block Pydantic AI assembled under that key -- replacing its
    text, or dropping it with `instructions=None`. This is how a managed config reaches text no
    capability owns: the agent's own literal, a toolset's, an MCP server's, one `@agent.instructions`
    function out of several. See [`InstructionPart.id`][pydantic_ai.messages.InstructionPart.id] for
    which blocks have a key at all.

    Both are applied in `before_model_request`, after every contribution has been assembled, so an
    override addresses what the model was about to be sent and an added block lands at the end of the
    run of static blocks -- last in the prompt as written, and still inside the prefix a provider can
    cache. An override leaves its block's position and its `dynamic` flag alone, so no override moves
    that cache boundary either. An added block is static for the same reason, unless `render_template`
    makes it a per-run rendering.

    When `name` is omitted, the variable name is derived from the agent's telemetry name using the
    same normalization as the Logfire UI, which is lossy: `checkout-assistant` and `checkout_assistant`
    both resolve `agent__checkout_assistant`, so two agents that differ only in punctuation -- in one
    service or across several in the same project -- share one managed config. Pass an explicit `name`
    to keep them apart. The variable is resolved once per run, and its label and version baggage
    remains active for the whole run.

    The managed `model` is sourced during model selection, so it slots in with the right precedence:
    a call-site `run(model=...)` beats it -- one run of one process, deliberately overriding what is
    published -- and it beats everything else, the agent's constructor model and any other
    capability's alike. A fully model-less `Agent(None, ...)` -- named or nameless -- can therefore be
    driven entirely from managed config. Managed settings work the same way, patching over the
    agent's and every other capability's; settings passed to `run()` still win.
    Static or callable targeting inputs participate in model selection, and the resulting variable
    resolution is reused for the rest of the run so the selected model and applied config cannot
    diverge. An unknown managed model warns and keeps the code model.

    Tool overrides change only the definitions shown to the model. Renames route back to the original
    implementation, collisions retain the original name, and an override the contract can't validate
    is dropped with a warning while its siblings still apply. An override names its tool by code-side
    `name`, narrowed to one toolset's tool of that name when it sets `toolset` too. Parameter names,
    types, requiredness, validation, and implementation stay code-owned.

    A published entry that reaches nothing -- an instruction `id` no assembled block carries (or only
    a dynamic one carries), a tool override no advertised tool matches, a rename another tool already
    answers to, a parameter patch the tool has no parameter for, a settings key the contract has no
    field for, a whole section it does not know -- is governed by `on_unmatched`, applied once per
    request to every section at once. The default warns once per process rather than raising, because
    one config is applied across deployments that need not all install the same toolsets, and a
    toolset can advertise different tools from one step to the next; an entry that reaches nothing
    here may be exactly right somewhere else. `'error'` is for the deployment that
    would rather stop than run with part of its published config silently unapplied.

    Missing, invalid, or unreachable remote values degrade to the code-defined agent through Logfire's
    resolution fallback, which is why a value the contract doesn't recognize degrades the narrowest
    unit that contains it -- one setting, one tool override, one section -- rather than the whole
    config.

    Nothing here ever writes to a variable. Every agent emits one `agent_control_config_hint` span
    per process carrying an `AgentConfig`-shaped snapshot of the code-side agent, whether or not a
    config resolved, and turning that into a real config -- or refreshing a stored baseline the code
    has moved on from -- is a Logfire-side flow the project's owner clicks through. So the credential
    this needs is read-only, and a code baseline can never overwrite something saved in the UI.

    The snapshot is taken from whichever model request comes first in the process, so for
    instructions or a toolset that vary with `deps`, run input, or the step within a run it is one
    point-in-time sample rather than a description of the agent, and an agent that never reaches a
    model request reports nothing. Its `instructions` are the code-defined
    blocks, listed separately with the `id` that addresses each block and a `dynamic` flag. This lets
    the UI offer an override per block instead of one copy-the-whole-prompt button that would produce
    exactly the duplication described above.

    ```python
    import logfire
    from pydantic_ai import Agent

    from pydantic_ai_harness.logfire import AgentControl

        capabilities=[AgentControl(label='production')],
    )
    result = agent.run_sync('Refund my last order.')

        This is how an agent gets onto the Agent Control page, and how it stays accurate once it is

        that into a config for an agent it has none for, or offers to refresh a stored baseline the
        code has moved on from. Reporting whether or not a config resolved is what makes the second
        half possible -- an agent that reported only while unconfigured would go quiet the moment
        someone configured it, and its stored baseline would describe the code as it was that day. It
        also matches what the platform has to do anyway: this SDK cannot tell an unknown variable from
        one with nothing published at this label, so deduplicating against the variables that exist is
        the platform's job either way.

        The span is named `agent_control_config_hint` and carries:

        - `agent_control.variable_name` -- the `agent__<key>` variable the config belongs in.
        - `agent_control.agent_name` -- the agent's `name` as written in code. The variable name is
          derived from it lossily, so this is what says *which* agent landed on that key. Left off
          when the capability was given a variable name of its own and the agent has no name at all:
          absent says "there is none", where a null-valued attribute would only raise the question of
          whether that is a name.
        - `agent_control.framework` -- which Agent Control SDK produced the hint; see `_FRAMEWORK`.
        - `agent_control.baseline_source` -- `'code'`, the contract's
          [`BaselineSource`][logfire.agent_control.BaselineSource] for a baseline read off the running
          code rather than observed from traffic.
        - `agent_control.schema_sha256` -- the contract schema this baseline was built against, so a
          consumer stores the matching JSON schema on the variable rather than guessing, and can tell
          a baseline from an older SDK from one it wrote the schema for.
        - `agent_control.baseline` -- the `AgentConfig` snapshot, as the JSON a variable's `example`
          holds. Absent when `agent_control.baseline_reduction` is `'omitted'`.
        - `agent_control.baseline_reduction` -- `'none'`, `'tool_definitions'`, or `'omitted'`: what
          the baseline had to give up to fit `_MAX_BASELINE_BYTES`. Always present, so a partial
          baseline is partial on the record rather than by inference.
        - `agent_control.baseline_bytes` -- the full baseline's UTF-8 size before any reduction.
        - `agent_control.baseline_sha256` -- the digest of the whole baseline; see `_baseline_sha256`.
          Present whatever `agent_control.baseline_reduction` says, and taken before any reduction, so
          two reports of the same code agree and two oversize reports of different code do not.
        - `agent_control.service_name`, `agent_control.environment`, `agent_control.service_version`
          -- which deployment reported it; see `_deployment_attributes`. Each is left off when the
          Logfire instance does not know it.
        - `agent_control.resolution_reason` -- why the run's variable resolved the way it did
          (`'resolved'`, `'code_default'`, ...). Since every agent reports, the span's existence no
          longer says whether one had a config, and this is the fact a consumer needs to tell a
          baseline that wants a config created from it from one that may only be refreshing a stale
          `example`. It is the same string the capability's `resolved` exposes, read where the hint
          is already built, so the platform learns it without a second query.

        Attributes rather than one nested blob because the hint is a contract with a consumer that
        queries it: a name it filters on and a size it can threshold have to be columns, and the
        baseline is the only one of them that is a document. They are prefixed with the capability's
        name the way every other harness capability's are.

        Emitted on the variable's own Logfire instance rather than on `ctx.tracer`, which is where
        this capability's operational telemetry would go. A hint is addressed to the project that
        would hold the config -- a process serving two projects has to reach each -- and it must not
        depend on core instrumentation being active to arrive. Emitted as a span rather than a log
        record for one more reason: a log below the configured `min_level` is dropped, and a signal
        the platform contract depends on cannot be something a logging setting silently withholds.

        The baseline quotes the agent's own instructions and tool descriptions, and is *not* held
        back by `trace_include_content`. What that flag governs is run content -- prompts, tool
        arguments, outputs -- and the contract's baseline builder already excludes every run-derived
        value: a dynamic block contributes its seam and never its rendering, and settings are reduced
        to the canonical keys, which is what keeps `extra_headers` and `extra_body` out. What remains
        is the agent as written, and an agent wired to Agent Control is one whose author asked for
        exactly that text to be editable in this Logfire project.

    A capability's [`CapabilityOrdering`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.CapabilityOrdering] position
    answers two questions at once: how its hooks nest around the run, and where its contributions
    land when Pydantic AI merges them. `AgentControl` needs opposite answers. Its resolution's label
    and version baggage has to envelop the whole run including the run span, which means `outermost`
    -- and `outermost` contributions are merged *first*, so every other capability's model and
    settings would be merged over the published ones. A managed value is an override, so the
    contributions that have to beat other capabilities live here instead, pinned `innermost` where
    they are merged last and win whatever order the capabilities were registered in.

    That is why this is a separate capability rather than a few more methods on `AgentControl`, and
    why it is *not* what a user constructs: `AgentControl` stays the leaf they build and find, and
    [`for_agent`][pydantic_ai_harness.logfire.AgentControl.for_agent] stitches this alongside it. The
    two share one object's state by reference, so there is still one variable, one resolution per
    run, and one thing to configure. Decoupling ordering from precedence in the framework itself is
    tracked in [#7420](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/7420); until then this split is
    what gives a published value the precedence the Logfire UI promises.
