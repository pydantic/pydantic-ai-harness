"""Storage backends for spilled tool outputs.

`WorkspaceStore` is the default: it writes each payload to a file inside the run's workspace
(`ctx.workspace`), or a workspace of its own, so with a remote sandbox the spilled files live in
the sandbox, next to the files the agent's other tools see. `OverflowStore` is the narrow
protocol for any other backend (a blob store, a durable engine's storage): persist a payload
under a key, read it back by handle. `LocalFileStore` implements it on the host filesystem.
