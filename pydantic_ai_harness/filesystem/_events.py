"""Events emitted by the filesystem capability.

Each event carries two path fields:

- `path`: normalized and relative to the emitting filesystem's root, never an
  absolute host path, so it is safe to echo to the model or a UI.
- `root_dir`: the absolute, symlink-resolved root the `path` is relative to,
  so a subscriber can locate the file (`Path(root_dir) / path`) without
  assuming it shares the emitter's root.

A diff in an event is a unified diff cut at `MAX_EVENT_DIFF_CHARS` with a
`truncated` flag, so an event stream that is persisted or forwarded to a UI
cannot be flooded by one large write.
