# FileSystem

Give an agent sandboxed, pattern-filtered access to a directory tree.

[Source](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/tree/main/pydantic_ai_harness/filesystem/)

## The problem

Letting an agent touch the filesystem directly is risky: path traversal
(`../../etc/passwd`), symlinks that escape the project, clobbering `.git`, or
leaking `.env` secrets. Hand-rolling the guards around every tool call is
repetitive and easy to get subtly wrong.

## The solution

`FileSystem` exposes a fixed set of file tools, all scoped to a single
`root_dir`. Every path is resolved and containment-checked (symlinks included)
before any I/O, and access is filtered through allow / deny / protected glob
patterns.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import FileSystem

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    capabilities=[FileSystem(root_dir='./workspace')],
)

result = agent.run_sync('Read config.toml and tell me the package name.')
print(result.output)
```

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `read_file` | Read a text file with line numbers and a content hash. Binary files are detected and not dumped. Supports `offset`/`limit` paging. |
| `write_file` | Create or overwrite a file. Optional `expected_hash` rejects stale writes (optimistic concurrency). |
| `edit_file` | Exact-string replacement; `old_text` must match exactly once. Optional `expected_hash`. |
| `list_directory` | List a directory's entries with type indicators and sizes. |
| `search_files` | Regex search over file contents, optionally narrowed by an `include_glob`. |
| `find_files` | Glob search over file names (e.g. `*.py`, `**/*.json`). The pattern is relative to `path`; absolute patterns are rejected. |
| `create_directory` | Create a directory and any missing parents. |
| `file_info` | Metadata for a file or directory (size, type, line count, hash, symlink target). |

## Events

`FileSystem` emits typed capability events in the `file_system` namespace so a
host can show what the agent did to the workspace, or veto a change before it
lands, without parsing tool arguments:

| Event | Dispatch | Operation | Payload |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FileChangeRequestEvent` | immediate | `write_file`, `edit_file`, `create_directory` | `path`, `root_dir`, `operation`, `diff`, `truncated`; `cancel(reason)` |
| `FileReadEvent` | stream | `read_file` | `path`, `root_dir`, `content_hash` |
| `DirectoryListedEvent` | stream | `list_directory` | `path`, `root_dir`, `entry_count` |
| `FileWrittenEvent` | stream | `write_file` | `path`, `root_dir`, `content_hash` |
| `FileEditedEvent` | stream | `edit_file` | a `FileWrittenEvent` plus `diff`, `truncated` |
| `DirectoryCreatedEvent` | stream | `create_directory` | `path`, `root_dir` |
| `FilesSearchedEvent` | stream | `search_files`, `find_files` | `path`, `root_dir`, `pattern`, `search` (`grep` or `find`), `match_count`, `truncated` |

`FileChangeRequestEvent` is a decision. It fires after the path has passed the
access checks and, for `edit_file`, after the conflict check, so a listener
only sees changes that would otherwise go ahead; a path the configuration
denies emits no request, so a listener cannot approve what the policy
refuses. A listener that calls `cancel(reason)` stops the change before it
touches the disk, and the model gets the reason as the tool result. `diff` is
the unified diff from the current content to the proposed content: a new file
diffs from empty, and a `create_directory` has no diff. A `create_directory`
on a directory that already exists changes nothing and emits nothing. The
other events are notifications.

`FileEditedEvent` subclasses `FileWrittenEvent`, so a listener for writes
receives edits too and can read the `diff` when it has one. Diffs are cut at
`MAX_EVENT_DIFF_CHARS` (8192) with a `truncated` flag, so a persisted or
forwarded event stream cannot be flooded by one large write. A
`FilesSearchedEvent` counts the matches the model received; `truncated` says
the search stopped at `max_search_results` or `max_find_results`.

`path` is the normalized, symlink-resolved location relative to `root_dir`,
never an absolute host path, so it is safe to echo to the model or a UI.
`root_dir` is the emitting filesystem's resolved root, so a subscriber rooted
elsewhere can locate the file as `Path(root_dir) / path` instead of assuming
it shares the emitter's root.

Every event path has passed the containment check and the denied patterns. A
`DirectoryListedEvent` or `FilesSearchedEvent` names the walk root, which is
not gated by `allowed_patterns` (see [Security model](#security-model)); only
its entries are. A denied or failed operation emits no event, including a
`read_file` whose `offset` is past the end of the file.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import FileSystem
from pydantic_ai_harness.filesystem import FileChangeRequestEvent

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[FileSystem()])

@agent.on_event(FileChangeRequestEvent)
async def hold_migrations(ctx, event):
    if event.path.startswith('migrations/'):
        event.cancel('migrations need a human')
```

Other capabilities subscribe with `@on_event` on a method, the way
`RepoContext` follows `FileReadEvent` and `DirectoryListedEvent`. A host with
its own file tools can emit the same event types by importing them from
`pydantic_ai_harness.filesystem`, which lets subscribers react without
depending on tool names or raw model arguments.

`FileSystem` emits no OpenTelemetry spans of its own: the core tool-call span
already records each operation and its result, and the events above carry the
diff a trace would not.

Tool errors the model can correct -- a missing file, a denied path, a stale
edit, a directory that collides with an existing file, an invalid glob pattern,
a path name rejected by Windows, a path name the filesystem cannot encode, an
over-long path name, a symlink loop -- are surfaced as
[`ModelRetry`](https://ai.pydantic.dev/agents/#reflection-and-self-correction),
so the agent gets the error message back and can adjust rather than aborting
the run. Failures the model can do nothing about, such as a full or read-only
disk, still abort.

When an OS error supplies a filename, `FileSystem` reports it relative to
`root_dir`; paths outside `root_dir` become `<outside-workspace>`. `file_info`
applies the same rule to absolute symlink targets.

## Security model

- **Containment.** Paths resolve relative to `root_dir`; anything resolving
  outside -- via `..`, an absolute path, or a symlink -- is rejected. Symlinks
  are resolved with `os.path.realpath` *before* the containment check, and I/O
  then uses the resolved path. Directory walks (`list_directory`,
  `search_files`, `find_files`) resolve each entry the same way and match the
  patterns against that resolved target, so a symlink cannot name a file
  outside the tree or present a denied file under a permitted name. These
  checks are pathname-based: if another process mutates the tree between
  resolution and I/O, the path read can differ from the path checked.
- **Binary detection.** `read_file` returns a placeholder instead of dumping
  binary bytes into the model context.
- **Optimistic concurrency.** `write_file`/`edit_file` accept an
  `expected_hash` so an agent operating on a stale read is told to re-read
  rather than silently overwriting newer content. Content hashes identify
  the file's bytes decoded without newline translation, so `read_file`,
  `write_file`, `edit_file`, and `file_info` agree regardless of line
  endings.
- **Regular write targets.** `write_file` rejects an existing target that is
  not a regular file. On POSIX, it opens the final target descriptor in
  non-blocking mode and checks that descriptor's type before truncating, so a
  FIFO at the final component cannot stall the tool even if it is swapped into
  place during the write.

## Pattern filtering

Three independent glob lists control access. Patterns are matched with
`fnmatch`, whose `*` spans `/`, so `*.py` matches `src/main.py` and you rarely
need `**`.

| Field | Effect |
|---|---|
| `allowed_patterns` | If non-empty, only matching paths are accessible (allowlist). |
| `denied_patterns` | Matching paths are always rejected (denylist). |
| `protected_patterns` | Matching paths are read-only -- reads succeed, writes are rejected. |

`protected_patterns` defaults to `.git/*`, `.env`/`.env.*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`,
and `**/secrets*`. Pass an empty list to disable protection.

### Direct access vs. walkers

The three rules apply at two different granularities:

- **Direct access** (`read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `file_info`,
  `create_directory`) gates the operation's target path. You must name a path
  that the patterns permit.
- **Walkers** (`list_directory`, `search_files`, `find_files`) gate their root
  by denied patterns, but **not** by `allowed_patterns` -- a directory root
  like `.` never matches a file pattern such as `src/*.py`, so requiring it to
  would make every listing fail. Instead, the root is walked and each
  **entry** is filtered with read-level access against `allowed_patterns` and
  `denied_patterns`. A directory listing cannot surface a path the agent
  couldn't otherwise read.

So with `allowed_patterns=['*.py']`, `list_directory('.')` succeeds and shows
only the `.py` entries; `read_file('notes.md')` is rejected.

Matching `protected_patterns` alone does not hide an entry. Protected paths
that pass the allowed, denied, and dotfile filters remain visible to all three
walkers and directly readable via `read_file`/`file_info`; write operations
reject them.

> Dotfiles and dot-directories (`.git`, `.env`, `.github`, ...) are skipped by
> all three walkers -- `list_directory`, `search_files`, and `find_files` --
> regardless of patterns.

## Configuration

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness import FileSystem

FileSystem(
    root_dir='.',                  # str | Path -- sandbox root
    allowed_patterns=[],           # allowlist globs (empty = allow all)
    denied_patterns=[],            # denylist globs
    protected_patterns=[...],      # read-only globs (defaults to secrets/.git)
    max_read_lines=2000,           # cap for a single read_file
    max_list_results=1000,         # cap for list_directory
    max_search_results=1000,       # cap for search_files
    max_find_results=1000,         # cap for find_files
)
```

The integer limits must be positive; they are validated at construction. A
walker that hits its cap ends its output with a `[... truncated at N ...]`
marker, and only when a further entry was actually dropped.

## Agent spec (YAML/JSON)

`FileSystem` works with Pydantic AI's
[agent spec](https://ai.pydantic.dev/agent-spec/):

```yaml
# agent.yaml
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6
capabilities:
  - FileSystem:
      root_dir: ./workspace
      allowed_patterns: ['*.py', '*.toml']
```

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness import FileSystem

agent = Agent.from_file('agent.yaml', custom_capability_types=[FileSystem])
```

Pass `custom_capability_types` so the spec loader knows how to instantiate
`FileSystem`.
