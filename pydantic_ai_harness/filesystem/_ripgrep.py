"""Run ripgrep inside the workspace and split its NUL-delimited output into records.

`rg` is invoked with `--null`, so every file path it prints ends in a NUL byte
and cannot be confused with the `:`/`-` separators of the match text that
follows it. The workspace returns a command's output whole, so the output is
cut inside the workspace at `_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES` (`head -c`) and records are then
streamed through the caller's `accept` filter until `limit` accepted records
have been collected; only kept records count towards the cap.
