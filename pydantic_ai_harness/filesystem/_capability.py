    capability. A run without one fails at its start. Relative paths resolve
    from the workspace's working directory.

    `root_dir` bounds the model's file tools: before each operation, the target
    must be inside it both as written and once the workspace has resolved its
    symlinks, and `read_only_patterns` guard what may be written. This is a
    guardrail checked before each operation, not isolation: a symlink swapped in
    between the check and the use is not caught, and `Shell` commands are not
    bounded at all. The workspace is the isolation boundary. Walks do not descend
    into a directory whose real path is outside `root_dir`.
