Pass these to keep provider credentials in an explicit `env` from reaching commands.
The patterns filter only `env`: the workspace decides the rest of a command's
environment, and a local workspace inherits nothing from the host unless given its
own `env`. Covers provider prefixes only -- not other secrets, and the
prefixes are coarse (`GOOGLE_*` also strips `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`), so
treat it as a starting point. Not a default: opt in explicitly.
