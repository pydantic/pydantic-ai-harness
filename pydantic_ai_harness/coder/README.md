# Coder

`Coder` gives a Pydantic AI agent tools and guidance for investigating, editing, and testing a codebase.
It works in the run's workspace, on this machine or in a sandbox. It is a regular combined capability made from [`FileSystem`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/filesystem/), [`Shell`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/shell/), [`RepoContext`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/repo-context/), and the [context management](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/compaction/) capabilities, so you can use it whole or take it apart.

> While Pydantic AI Harness is on 0.x releases, the API may change between minor releases; when it does, deprecation warnings and release-note migration guidance tell you (or your agent) exactly how to upgrade. See the [version policy](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/#version-policy).

## Usage

Install the Coder extra to include ripgrep (`rg`), which backs the `list_files` and `grep` tools:

uv:

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[coder]"
```

pip:

```bash
pip install "pydantic-ai-harness[coder]"
```

The extra installs `ripgrep==14.1.0` except on Android, where `rg` must be supplied separately on `PATH`.
In a workspace without `rg`, such as a sandbox image that lacks it, `list_files` and `grep` walk the files instead.

For remote workspaces, use file tools (`grep`, `find_files`, `read_file`) instead of sending whole files through shell `cat`. Install `rg` and `git` in the sandbox image for fast search (the Coder extra installs `rg` on the agent host, not in a remote image). For large or generated trees, run `rg -n 'pattern' path` or `rg --files` through Shell and cap its output. Without `rg`, file walks make many remote calls; filesystem-only backends use this slower, bounded path. Check ignored and hidden files explicitly when using the fallback.
Add a provider extra such as `[coder,anthropic]` when needed.
`Coder` works in the run's [workspace](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/core-concepts/workspace/). Here that is the current directory on your machine:

<!-- Keep this blown-out example in sync across docs/coder.md, docs/index.md, README.md, pydantic_ai_harness/coder/README.md, and examples/coding_agent.py. -->

```python {names="defined"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import LocalWorkspace
from pydantic_ai_harness.coder import Coder

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-opus-5-5',
    capabilities=[LocalWorkspace('.'), Coder()],
)
agent.run_sync('Find out why tests/test_parser.py fails and fix the bug it caught.')
```

File paths resolve from the workspace's working directory, and commands start there. To work in an isolated cloud machine instead, swap `LocalWorkspace` for a sandbox capability (Modal, E2B, Daytona, or Sprites); nothing else changes. Commands run without an allowlist, and the file tools' path limits don't apply to them.

[`agent.to_cli_sync()`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/cli/) and [`agent.to_web()`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/web/) use the same workspace.

The exported `pydantic_ai_harness.coder:coder_agent` is the same agent, model-less and named `coder`, working in the directory that is current when it is imported.
Use it with the Pydantic AI CLI:

```bash
uvx --with "pydantic-ai-harness[coder]" clai -a pydantic_ai_harness.coder:coder_agent -m anthropic:claude-opus-5-5
```

### The command environment

Commands in a `LocalWorkspace` get your `PATH` and `HOME`, so they find your tools and their configuration, and nothing else from your environment. Add what they need with `LocalWorkspace('.', env={...})`. Don't pass `os.environ`: that hands the model's commands every secret in the process, LLM API keys included.

## Sharing a workspace

A workspace outlives the run that used it. To continue the conversation in the same files, pass its messages:

```python {names="defined"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import LocalWorkspace
from pydantic_ai_harness.coder import Coder

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-opus-5-5', capabilities=[LocalWorkspace('.'), Coder()])
result = agent.run_sync('Add a --verbose flag to the CLI.')
result = agent.run_sync('Document the new flag in the README.', message_history=result.all_messages())
```

Message history can't move a `LocalWorkspace` to another directory.

To hand the work to another agent, or start a fresh conversation in the same files, pass the workspace itself:

```python {names="defined"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import LocalWorkspace
from pydantic_ai_harness.coder import Coder

coder = Agent('anthropic:claude-opus-5-5', capabilities=[LocalWorkspace('.'), Coder()])
reviewer = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-opus-5-5',
    capabilities=[Coder(instructions='Review the uncommitted change and run the tests. Do not edit files.')],
)

result = coder.run_sync('Add a --verbose flag to the CLI.')
review = reviewer.run_sync('Review the change.', workspace=result.workspace)
```

The reviewer works in the workspace you pass. With a sandbox, this is how several agents share one isolated machine. [`SubAgents`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/subagents/) needs nothing extra: each delegate runs in the parent's workspace.

## Composition

`Coder()` is these capabilities, in this order:

1. A `Capability` carrying the default instructions, plus any `instructions=` you pass.
2. [`FileSystem`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/filesystem/)`(content_hashes=False, max_read_chars=50000, tools=FILE_TOOL_NAMES)`, where
   `FILE_TOOL_NAMES` is `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `list_files`, and `grep`. Its `root_dir` is the workspace's working directory.
3. [`Shell`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/shell/)`(denied_commands=[], allow_interactive=True, default_timeout=270, tools=['shell'])`.
4. [`RepoContext`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/repo-context/)`(expose_inventory_tool=False)` for repository instructions and structure.
   Pass `repo_context=False` to leave it out when the agent already binds its own `RepoContext`, so the
   instruction files are not loaded twice.

Then the plumbing, which the agent never calls directly:

5. [`ClearToolResults`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/compaction/)`(max_fraction=0.7)` and [`WarnNearLimits`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/compaction/)`(max_context_fraction=0.9)`.
6. A private [`ToolOutputLimits`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/tool-output-limits/) specialization that truncates any tool result over 64,000 characters
   without adding a spill-retrieval tool. Its stable ID, `coder_tool_output_limits`, lets durability
   capabilities bind its inherited operations without colliding with a separately configured `ToolOutputLimits`.
7. [`RepairToolArguments`](../repair_tool_arguments/) repairs malformed JSON tool arguments before normal validation (see below).

Every tool comes from `FileSystem` or `Shell`; those pages document each one in full. Build the same
agent from the pieces to change any setting, for example to keep content hashes, add `list_directory`,
or allowlist commands.

## Six tools

| Tool | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `read_file(path, offset=0, limit=None)` | Zero-based line offset, one-based displayed line numbers, up to 2,000 lines or 50,000 characters of complete lines; the continuation hint names the exact next offset, and a line too long for the window is named and skippable. No hash header. |
| `write_file(path, content)` | Create a file in an existing directory, or replace one. No `expected_hash`. |
| `edit_file(path, old_text, new_text)` or `edit_file(path, replacements=[...])` | Exact replacements, each matching once; a batch is checked in memory and written only if every replacement matches. |
| `list_files(path='.', glob=None)` | `rg --files`, sorted by path, respecting ignore files and skipping hidden files. |
| `grep(pattern, ...)` | Ripgrep search with `path`, `glob`, `file_type`, `ignore_case`, `literal`, and `context` (0 to 20). |
| `shell(command, mode='foreground', timeout=270)` | Unrestricted commands rooted at the workspace that outlive the run. |

Results are bounded by `FileSystem`'s caps (2,000 lines or 50,000 characters per `read_file`, 1,000 lines or files per search or listing) and Coder's 64,000-character
tool-output limit; a truncation marker means more output was omitted, so narrow the search rather than
assuming it was complete. A `read_file` window stays under the output limit, so paging by `offset` never skips lines. Use `shell` for `mkdir`, `find`, process inspection, and `kill`. File writes
keep the standalone filesystem's read-only path rules (`.git`, `.env`, keys, and secrets); shell can bypass
these rules. Coder does not include planning, delegation, or the `run_command` family.

## Filesystem scope

File tools are scoped to the workspace's working directory by default. For trusted local use,
`Coder(unrestricted_filesystem=True)` sets `FileSystem(root_dir='/',
read_only_patterns=[])`: relative paths still resolve from the working directory, and absolute paths anywhere in
the run's workspace are accepted, such as `/tmp/example.py`. OS permissions and file-change event listeners still apply. This permits
modifying secrets and repository metadata: use it only when you trust the agent and its inputs. Shell commands
were already unrestricted.

## Long-running commands

`shell` is the [`Shell`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/shell/) capability's persistent tool. Foreground waits at most 270 seconds
(or a smaller positive `timeout`) and then returns handles for the same running process; background returns
them immediately. Both end with a PID, an absolute output log path, and an absolute JSON status path (inside the workspace) whose
`exit_code` is `null` while the command runs; foreground puts the last 16,000 bytes of output before them. Commands outlive the agent run, so servers keep running; there
is no completion notification or automatic wake-up after a final response. The Shell page covers the
supervisor, cleanup, and the `CommandStartedEvent`, `CommandOutputEvent`, and `CommandFinishedEvent` progress
events a UI can subscribe to.

The default instructions tell the agent to finish required work before giving a final response: do other
useful work, then poll status and output until completion or a genuine blocker.
Servers may remain running after startup and readiness are verified. Commands get only the environment
the workspace passes (see [The command environment](#the-command-environment)); host files remain
accessible to commands in a local workspace.

## Instructions

The default instructions keep engineering guidance brief: autonomous investigation and completion,
focused changes and verification, and pragmatic DRY, YAGNI, SOLID, and the Zen of Python.
Tool descriptions supply tool usage; `RepoContext` supplies repository instructions and structure.
`Coder(instructions='...')` appends project-specific guidance rather than replacing defaults.
Use it for additional policy, such as file-size limits or a preferred verification workflow.

## Tool argument repair

`Coder` composes [`RepairToolArguments`](../repair_tool_arguments/), which uses `json-repair` for malformed JSON before Pydantic AI validates the tool schema.
Valid JSON and already-parsed arguments pass through unchanged. Missing fields and invalid types still
follow normal validation and retry behavior. Repair applies to tools added alongside Coder too.
If the repair parser raises a value or recursion error, original arguments go through normal validation.

Repair is heuristic: malformed input can be ambiguous, and inferred strings may differ from the model's
intent. It does not supply a schema to the repair library or bypass exact edit matching.
Each attempt emits a `repair_tool_arguments` span through `ctx.tracer`, without arguments or file
contents. Other Coder operations rely on core tool spans and on the events its `FileSystem` and `Shell`
capabilities emit.

## Durable execution

`Coder` works under DBOS, Temporal and Prefect durable execution. Under Temporal its tools run
in activities, which cannot reach the run's event stream yet ([pydantic-ai#7971](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/7971)), so
they emit no `FileSystem` or `Shell` events there and a `FileChangeRequestEvent` listener cannot
refuse a change.

## Upgrading

This release makes the workspace the single place that decides where an agent works. Removed arguments are still accepted, emit a `HarnessDeprecationWarning` naming the fix, and are ignored.

- **Attach a workspace.** `Coder`, `FileSystem`, `Shell`, `RepoContext`, and `Macroscope` fail at run start without one, as do `Skills`, `PydanticAIDocs` (with a local checkout), and `ToolOutputLimits` (when it can spill) unless given their own `workspace=` or store. Add `LocalWorkspace('.')` to the agent's capabilities, as in [Usage](#usage).
Sandbox refs identify existing environments; provider-specific cleanup should use an ID-only delete API for refs your application owns (where that provider offers one). Do not create or attach a backend merely to delete a sandbox. Directory upload and preview URLs depend on the provider SDK.

With a remote sandbox such as `ModalSandbox(working_dir='/workspace')`, `Coder` loads repo instructions at run start, which creates the sandbox before the model's first tool call. Use `Coder(repo_context=False)` if the sandbox should be created lazily. Choose a working directory that exists in your image.

- **Set the directory on the workspace.** `Coder('dir')`, `Shell(cwd=)`, `FileSystem(cwd=)`, `Macroscope(cwd=)`, and `RepoContext(workspace_dir=)` are ignored; use `LocalWorkspace('./dir')`.
- **Pass the command environment.** A local workspace used to give commands the host's `PATH`, `HOME`, `LANG`, and `TMPDIR`; now they get its `PATH` and `HOME`, plus the workspace's `env` and `Shell(env=)`. Pass anything else they need, such as `LANG`, with `LocalWorkspace('.', env={...})` (see [The command environment](#the-command-environment)).
- **`FileSystem(root_dir=)`** defaults to the working directory and resolves relative values from it. It must contain the working directory, symlinks that lead outside it are refused, and `root_dir='/'` turns the checks off.
- **Harness files moved into the working directory.** Tool-output spills and Shell background-job files are under `.pydantic-ai-harness/` (git-ignored) instead of `$TMPDIR`. `ToolOutputLimits(store=LocalFileStore())` keeps spills on this machine.
- **Skills** are read from the workspace at run start and loaded as deferred capabilities. [`Skills(workspace=LocalWorkspaceBackend('/app'))`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/skills/) reads them from somewhere else.
- **[`Researcher`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/researcher/)** spills oversized tool results to the workspace instead of `$TMPDIR`, so it needs one too.
- **Sub-agent definitions** are read from the workspace at run start, and `~/.agents/agents/` is no longer read. [`SubAgents(workspace=LocalWorkspaceBackend('/app'))`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/subagents/) reads them from somewhere else.
- **[Memory's `FileStore`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/memory/)** keeps its files in the workspace, and receipts in `.memory-operations.json` replace its SQLite journal. `FileStore('.', workspace=LocalWorkspaceBackend('/path'))` keeps them on this machine.
- **Capability Creation** runs only when the workspace is a writable `LocalWorkspace`.
