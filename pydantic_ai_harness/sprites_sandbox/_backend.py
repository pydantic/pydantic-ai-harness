"""Fly.io Sprites backend for Pydantic AI's `WorkspaceBackend` protocol.

External assumptions last verified 2026-09-25 against sprites-py 0.7.0 source, the Sprites API
docs, and (2026-09-15) a local WebSocket transport probe, with no live cloud calls:

* `AsyncSpritesClient` requires its token as an argument and reads no environment variable; sprite
  creation uses the SDK's fixed 120-second request timeout, while `aclose` closes the local async
  HTTP client and control pools:
  https://github.com/superfly/sprites-py/blob/v0.7.0/src/sprites/async_client.py
* `create_sprite` and `get_sprite` raise `AuthenticationError` (401), `NotFoundError` (404),
  `NetworkError` (transport), and a plain `SpriteError` for any other HTTP failure:
  https://github.com/superfly/sprites-py/blob/v0.7.0/src/sprites/client.py
* Commands run over the documented exec WebSocket through the SDK's `WSCommand`, the SDK's own
  default path. It sends stdin EOF when no stdin is given, reads the exit status from the binary
  EXIT frame or the JSON `exit` message, raises `NetworkError` when the socket closes before either,
  and turns a failed handshake into a parsed `APIError` carrying the HTTP status. The working
  directory goes in the `dir` query parameter as the SDK sends it; the API page lists `dir` only
  for the HTTP exec endpoint:
  https://github.com/superfly/sprites-py/blob/v0.7.0/src/sprites/websocket.py
* The exec API starts the command as soon as the request arrives, before the client's output
  stream is attached, and replays only the last 16 or 64 KiB printed before then: the rest was lost
  with exit status 0 (observed against real Sprites on 2026-09-26). So every command waits for the
  client's stdin EOF, which the SDK sends once the socket is open, before it starts.
* The exec API takes argv in the WebSocket URL, which the Sprite refuses (HTTP 414) above about
  40 KB, so file writes go through the filesystem API (`PUT /fs/write`) instead. It writes through
  a symlink, creates missing parents, owns the file to the Sprite's user, and sets the mode it is
  given, replacing an existing file's; a 404 means either a missing path or a deleted Sprite
  (observed 2026-09-26):
  https://github.com/superfly/sprites-py/blob/v0.7.0/src/sprites/async_filesystem.py
* The multiplexed control protocol (`sprites.control`, used only in the SDK's opt-in control mode)
  is not used: in 0.7.0 its `op.complete` handler overwrites the exit status from the EXIT frame
  with the message's own `exitCode`, which defaults to 0, so every command reported success
  (observed against real Sprites on 2026-09-25):
  https://github.com/superfly/sprites-py/blob/v0.7.0/src/sprites/control.py
* The exec API documents that a set `env` replaces the default environment, so the backend does
  not pass `env`; it runs the command under the POSIX `env` utility instead, which adds the
  variables to the Sprite's own environment:
  https://sprites.dev/api/sprites/exec
* A disconnect does not stop a non-TTY command at once; it keeps running for
  `max_run_after_disconnect` (10 seconds by default; `0` means no limit, as the TTY default shows).
  The backend asks for one second, so closing the socket on a timeout or cancellation ends the
  command shortly after:
  https://sprites.dev/api/sprites/exec
* Provider retention is separate from local client disconnect:
  https://docs.sprites.dev/concepts/lifecycle/

Re-check these sources, the installed signatures, and the local transport probe before changing
lifecycle or command transport behavior. The integration uses the SDK's native asyncio client.
